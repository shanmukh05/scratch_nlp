 i pushed my glasses up the bridge of my nose and sighed as i stared at the papers i 'd dropped . 
 this was shaping up to be the worst day ever , and it was only my second day on the job . 
 first , i 'd lost a contact and had to break out my clunky emergency glasses , then the ceo 's assistant called in sick before the biggest stockholder meeting of the year . 
 of course , they 'd called me in to assist , even though she was only the front desk receptionist . 
 if all mr. drake wants me to do is answer phones , i 've got this in the bag . 
 i rolled my eyes , knowing it could n't possibly be that easy . 
 i had n't met chase drake yet , billionaire ceo of drake and smith , but i 'd heard whispered rumors about him over lunch . 
 words like `` terrifying '' and `` gorgeous '' were thrown around , along with talk of all the other executive assistants that quit unexpectedly that year . 
 apparently , he was impossible to please . 
 i dropped to my knees , hurriedly gathering the papers outside of the executive offices . 
 this is no way to make a first impression , isabeau ! 
 get it together or you wo n't last the week . 
 the last thing i needed was for the head honcho to see me like this . 
 a black , italian leather shoe came down an inch from my hand . 
 i froze , still reaching for the spreadsheet now trapped under the large foot in front of me . 
 it was attached to a leg clad in an impeccably cut suit , and as i ran my eyes upward , i tried not to tremble . 
 a man with wavy blonde hair and a cool green gaze stared down at me , his cruel mouth twisted into a smirk . 
 `` ms. willcox , i presume ? '' 
 i tried to push the chestnut strands of hair that had fallen over my eyes back into my bun , but it was no good . 
 i was a hot mess , kneeling on the carpet in a j.c. penney blouse and skirt . 
 `` y-yes ? '' 
 he reached down and offered his hand , and my mouth suddenly went very , very dry . 
 i 'm talking sahara desert dry . 
 something about the way he looked at me sent shivers down my spine , like he was sizing me up . 
 like i was a deer , and he was a lion , looking for his next meal . 
 i put my hand in his , and let him pull me to my feet . 
 my hand felt tiny in his warm grasp , and i felt a jolt of electricity at the touch . 
 `` chase drake , '' he said softly , his low voice making my heart skip a beat . 
 `` so , you 're the one serving me today ? '' 
 serving him ? 
 it felt like an odd way to put it , but hey , who was i to correct the boss ? 
 `` i guess so , sir . '' 
 `` you guess ? '' 
 i realized my hand was still in his , and quickly drew it back . 
 `` ms. johnson told me you needed an assistant for the meeting ? '' 
 i bit my lip , suddenly uncertain . 
 his piercing eyes were hard to look directly into . 
 i felt like i was being tested , or maybe that i was in the wrong place altogether . 
 `` keep your chin up , girl . 
 my assistant must be cool , confident and collected , not a timid little mouse . '' 
 my mouth dropped open . 
 a mouse ? 
 he does n't even know me ! 
 i raised my chin defiantly , straightening up to my full height . 
 `` yes , sir . '' 
 his lips twitched into a half smile . 
 `` very good . '' 
 i nodded , and started walking toward the boardroom , when he grabbed my wrist , making me gasp . 
 he drew me close until we were almost nose to nose . 
 `` remember that you represent me in there . 
 clean yourself up before we begin . 
 and ms. willcox ? '' 
 `` y-yes ? '' 
 `` do n't let me down . '' 
 i tried hard not to tremble , even though he 'd pulled me so close . 
 he smelled clean like rainwater , but his hot breath on my face made me avert my eyes . 
 is this how he always acted ? 
 so demanding and confrontational ? 
 `` will do , boss . '' 
 i snatched my wrist away and moved quickly down the hall to the ladies room . 
 i could feel his gaze on my back until the door closed behind me . 
 when it clicked shut , i leaned back against it , and let out a deep breath . 
 what an ass ** le . 
 i was beginning to wonder if the executive assistant was really sick , or if she was just sick of his domineering bullshit . 
 but , despite my irritation , my wrist tingled where he 'd held me , and i could n't stop thinking about those eyes of his , that strong jaw ... and how i wanted to run my hands through that gorgeous wavy hair of his . 
 `` get over it , isa . 
 never gon na happen , '' i muttered to myself . 
 whoa . 
 where did that come from ? 
 i mean , sure , he was amazing looking , and from the moment his eyes met mine , i felt a magnetism radiating off him , drawing me to him , but that did n't mean i was interested . 
 far from it , after the way he 'd just spoken to me . 
 i ran my hands under the sink and slicked my hair back , redoing my bun as best i could at the nape of my neck . 
 my hair was always unruly and wild . 
 i just hoped it would stay put for the next hour . 
 i retouched my light makeup , and looked at myself in the mirror . 
 it would have to do . 
 i took a deep breath , and readied myself to face mr. drake . 
 *** the meeting went off without a hitch . 
 i sat next to the ceo running his slides as he presented to the table full of crusty old men . 
 standing before them , speaking so smoothly and confidently , the juxtoposition of his youth and power against the rest of them was not lost on me . 
 he moved with the kind of grace and power you 'd expect of royalty , commanding the attention and respect of everyone in the room . 
 at the end , as the board members filed out into the hallway , he came up behind me and put a hand on my shoulder . 
 i flinched beneath his touch . 
 `` meet me in my office in half an hour . '' 
 i pursed my lips , a spike of fear coursing through me . 
 had i done something wrong ? 
 was i getting fired ? 
 it would officially be the shortest temp job ever . 
 what would my friends say when they heard i 'd gotten canned on my second day ? 
 `` yes , sir , '' i squeaked . 
 he swept out of the room , and i heard him laughing and joking with the other men as they moved down the hall . 
 i put my head down and packed up his notes and laptop , trying to get my shit together as i worked . 
 calm down , isa . 
 what will be , will be . 
 i pictured those cool eyes staring at me as he mouthed the words `` we 're letting you go , '' and felt a shiver creep down my spine . 
 for some reason , the look of disappointment i pictured on his handsome face was the worst part . 
 *** i rapped on the mahogany door at the end of the executive wing , and tried to steady my breathing . 
 `` come in . '' 
 `` here goes nothing , '' i whispered , and entered the office , trying to hold my chin high . 
 mr. drake looked up at me , his green eyes intense , but the emotion behind them unreadable . 
 was he angry with me ? 
 had i embarassed him somehow ? 
 i was so inexperienced , i was positive it was n't good . 
 `` ms. willcox , come here . '' 
 i smoothed my hands over my skirt and took a few steps toward the chairs in front of his desk . 
 `` did i say you could sit there ? 
 come here . 
 to me . '' 
 i paused , shifting uncomfortably on my feet . 
 `` are you deaf ? 
 i said come here . '' 
 his sharp tone sent a shiver down my spine . 
 i set my jaw and walked around the desk until i was just inches away from him . 
 he spun in his chair toward me slowly and leaned back , a smirk playing over his handsome face . 
 for a long moment , he just looked me over , appraising me , then staring into my eyes to see if i would look away , i suppose . 
 i did n't . 
 `` take a seat here . 
 on the desk . '' 
 his voice was a low whisper , his eyes intense . 
 i hesitated the briefest of moments , but then a little voice inside my head said he 's messing with you . 
 he wants to see if you 're afraid . 
 i glared back at him . 
 i needed to show him he did n't intimidate me , no matter how rich and powerful he was . 
 i hopped up on the edge of his desk , and crossed my bare legs demurely . 
 his eyes roamed over my exposed skin , stopping at my hem line , before moving up my body to my br ** sts , straining beneath my blouse . 
 i tried to keep my breathing steady , but i felt so vulnerable this close to him , especially when he looked at me like that . 
 `` what do you know about me , isabeau ? '' 
 he leaned forward , and i forced myself to stay still instead of shying away . 
 he was so close that i could smell the subtle notes of his cologne : musk and wood with a hint of leather . 
 `` my apologies ... may i call you isabeau ? '' 
 he smiled up at me , dazzling me for a moment . 
 `` of course . '' 
 my voice sounded high and breathy . 
 i gripped the edge of his desk , trying not to fidget . 
 `` good . 
 what have you heard about me , isabeau ? 
 what do you really know about me ? '' 
 what did he want me to say ? 
 that everyone said he was an ogre ? 
 or that they all wanted to sleep with him anyway ? 
 `` i. . . '' 
 `` go on . 
 you wo n't hurt my feelings . '' 
 he was still smiling , slight dimples visible in both cheeks . 
 the sight was destracting , to say the least . 
 `` i know that you 're the youngest ceo and partner in the company 's history , and i know that you earned the spot by working your way up after graduate school instead of using your inheritance as a crutch . '' 
 `` everyone knows that . 
 what do you know about me ? 
 the real stuff . 
 none of this press release bullshit . '' 
 i looked down at my hands , anything not to have to look up at his face so close to me . 
 `` um . 
 people say ... they say that you 're scary . 
 and that your assistants do n't last long . '' 
 he laughed , a deep , warm sound that seemed to fill up the office . 
 i glanced up to see him smirking at me . 
 i relaxed my grip on the desk a little . 
 maybe i was n't being fired after all . 
 `` what else do they say ? '' 
 oh , god . 
 he ca n't possibly want me to tell him everything . 
 does he ? 
 the look on his face confirmed that he did . 
 it was clear by the way he looked at me that i was n't leaving this office until i gave him exactly what he wanted . 
 `` they say . 
 um ... they say that you 're very , uh , good looking ... and impossible to please . '' 
 `` oh they do , do they ? '' 
 he sat back , and tented his fingers beneath his chin . 
 `` well , do you agree with them ? 
 do you think i 'm scary , handsome and woefully unsatisfied ? '' 
 my mouth dropped open , and i quickly closed it with a snap . 
 `` yes . 
 i mean , no ! 
 i mean , i do n't know ... '' he stood , then , and leaned in close , towering over me . 
 `` you were right the first time . '' 
 anxiety coursed through me , but i have to admit , being this close to him , smelling his scent and feeling the heat radiating off his body , it made me wonder what it would be like to be in his arms . 
 to be his . 
 to be owned by him ... his face was almost touching mine when he whispered to me . 
 `` i am unsatisfied , isabeau . 
 i want you to be my new assistant . 
 will you do that for me ? 
 will you be at my beck and call ? '' 
 my breath left me as his words sunk in . 
 when i finally regained it , i felt like i was trembling from head to toe . 
 his beck and call . 
 `` wh-what about your old assistant ? '' 
 mr. drake leaned back again and took my chin in his hand , forcing my eyes to his . 
 `` what about her ? 
 i want you . '' 
 his touch on my skin was electric . 
 are we still talking about business ? 
 `` yes , mr. drake . '' 
 his thumb stroked my cheek for the briefest of moments , and then he released me , breathless , and wondering what i 'd just agreed to . 
 `` very good , isabeau . 
 i 'll expect you here at 8 a.m. tomorrow , in my office , ready to work . 
 do n't be late . '' 
 he turned away , effectively dismissing me . 
 i hopped down off the desk and quickly made for the door . 
 i did n't want to give him time to change his mind . 
 `` and isabeau ? '' 
 i turned back , my hand on the knob . 
 `` yes , mr. drake ? '' 
 `` i do n't tolerate sloppy work . 
 disappoint me , and there will be consequences . '' 
 i blushed , and nodded , then closed the door behind me . 
 what had i gotten myself into ? 
 *** `` isabeau ! 
 get in here , now ! '' 
 i jumped in my seat in front of the big , mahogany doors , spilling my cup of ramen noodles onto my blouse . 
 `` shit ! 
 shit , shit , shit . '' 
 if there was one thing mr. drake hated , it was sloppiness , and here i was dripping with cheap soup stock . 
 my silk was stained , the material sticking to the tops of my br ** sts . 
 `` by now , i meant immediately , isabeau ! 
 not at your personal convenience . '' 
 i swore again under my breath , and entered his office . 
 maybe a miracle would occur , and he would n't notice . 
 please , god , have mercy ! 
 `` sit , '' he commanded . 
 i moved toward the chairs once again , but he stared at me , frowing , until i circled the desk and perched on the edge . 
 `` yes , mr. drake ? '' 
 `` what took you so long ? 
 i need you to type these notes up for me , and ... '' he stopped , sniffing the air . 
 he leaned in , and to my horror , plucked a long , wavy noodle out of my cle ** age . 
 i bit my lip , tears of embarassment burning behind my eyes . 
 i had to keep it together . 
 it probably was n't the end of the world , even though it felt like it , sitting here in front of my boss , who could have been a gq model , shaking with nerves , and dripping with soup . 
 `` oh , my dear , '' he said , placing it into his trashcan like it was a dead spider . 
 `` this is not good at all . 
 i do n't like this . 
 one . 
 little . 
 bit . '' 
 he was out of his chair in a flash , and before i could stop him , his hands were on my blouse , undoing my buttons with speed and precision . 
 `` mr. drake ! '' 
 he ripped the last button off , and i winced as the silk tore . 
 my shirt fell open , revealing my bra , and he yanked it down off my shoulders and threw it to the floor . 
 `` i thought i made it clear that i do not tolerate sloppiness ? '' 
 his voice was deep and dripping with menace . 
 i tried to cover myself , but he slapped my hands away and ran his eyes over my exposed curves without a hint of embarassment . 
 `` you represent me , isabeau . 
 me ! 
 and i do not present myself in such a disgusting manner . 
 not to my colleages . 
 not to anyone . '' 
 he leaned forward , caging me in with a hand on each side of my body . 
 his face was just an inch from mine , his clean breath tickling my lips . 
 what was he going to do to me ? 
 `` i. . . 
 i 'm sorry , '' i breathed . 
 `` sorry 's not going to cut it , girl . 
 you seem to have a problem remembering what my rules are . 
 you 've been lax . 
 lazy . 
 disheveled . 
 i think it 's high time you were punished . '' 
 he toyed with one of my bra straps , then slid it slowly down one shoulder . 
 i tensed , wondering how far he would go . 
 fear coursed through me , but at the same time , my heart raced , my sex heating against the surface of the desk . 
 i had to admit it , even if it was just to myself ... i wanted him . 
 there was something mesmerizing about him . 
 something forceful and dangerous . 
 something i could n't resist , even if i wanted to . 
 and i was n't sure that i did . 
 `` you need to remember who you belong to . '' 
 his voice was a low growl now as he traced the top of my br ** sts with a long finger . 
 was this really happening ? 
 i suppressed a moan , suppressed the desire to reach up and run my hands through his hair , to pull his mouth down to mine . 
 `` you need a punishment you wo n't soon forget . '' 
 he backed away , and i felt his absence like a tangible thing . 
 `` turn around and place your hands flat on the desk . '' 
 i gasped , looking at him in disbelief . 
 had i heard him right ? 
 part of me wondered if he was going to raise my skirt , jerk my panties down around my ankles , and f ** k me right then and there . 
 and if he did , would i let him ? 
 would i stay bent over while my billionaire boss used me for his pleasure ? 
 my pu ** y heated at the thought . 
 a man like him wanting me was almost too much to handle . 
 i did as i was told and placed my palms flat on the desk , leaning over as i did so . 
 i waited for him to grip my zipper ; to rip my skirt off my body or push it up over my hips . 
 i was ready to be his . 
 to be possessed . 
 his hand came down hard on my ass , making me yell in surprise . 
 i winced , my eyes watering from the impact . 
 i wanted to look at mr. drake , to ask what he was thinking , but something kept my hands firmly on the desk , helpless beneath him . 
 `` you 've been very bad , '' he growled . 
 his hand came down again with a smack that took my breath away . 
 i mewled as the stinging washed over me , but held my place , not wanting to disappoint him . 
 despite the pain , my panties were wet , my pu ** y ready for him . 
 i felt helpless and sensual and wild , like never before . 
 who was this isabeau bending over for her boss ? 
 i did n't know her , but i also did n't want to stop feeling this way . 
 `` you will not disobey me ! '' 
 another blow made me yelp , then another , reddening the same spots he 'd hit before , making my ass burn beneath the thin material of my skirt . 
 i felt the bruises forming , and bit my lip , trying not to scream as his hand came down again and again . 
 the office echoed with the sound of his hand cracking down mercilessly on my tender flesh , and my panting as i stood there and took every blow , legs shaking , pu ** y glowing with need for this man . 
 finally , he paused , and i felt him lift the hem of my skirt up and over my ass . 
 i whimpered as the fabric grazed my abused skin . 
 `` let 's see if you 've learned your lesson ... '' i knew he must be admiring his handiwork , leaning over me , inspecting my backside , on display for him . 
 `` oh yes . 
 this punishment should be a constant reminder over the next few days to behave . 
 every time you sit , you 'll remember this little lesson . '' 
 his hand smoothed over my ass , clad only in my sheer , white panties . 
 i gasped as he squeezed the bruised flesh , and felt my face burning with shame . 
 i knew he could see the wet spot between my legs . 
 what must he think of me ? 
 `` what is this , isabeau ? '' 
 his voice was a dangerous rumble . 
 `` i can smell your arousal from here . 
 my nostrils are filled with it ... '' his hands kneaded my ass cheeks roughly , making me moan in pain . 
 `` look at you . 
 look at this ! '' 
 his fingers forced their way past the thin cotton mesh of my underwear and dipped roughly into my wetness . 
 i squirmed against his touch , and his hand came down on my ass again , making me burn all over . 
 `` you little slut . 
 you 're loving this , are n't you ? '' 
 he spanked me again and again , all the while pumping two fingers into my tight , eager channel . 
 i was yelling then , my body squeezing around him with each stroke . 
 i could n't believe he was doing this , and what was more , i was enjoying every second . 
 just like he said . 
 `` answer me when i speak to you , isabeau ! '' 
 mr. drake 's fingers increased speed , making me moan loudly into the desk . 
 `` are you enjoying this ? 
 do you think this is a game ? '' 
 he spanked me harder , slamming my h * ps into the wood as he finger f ** ked me . 
 i was so close to cumming , but i tried to hold it back . 
 i did n't know what his reaction would be if i came undone beneath him . 
 `` yes ! '' 
 i breathed . 
 `` i mean , no . 
 it 's ... ahhhh ... it 's not a game ... '' `` you 're goddamn right , it 's not a game ! '' 
 mr. drake reached around my body and pinched my cl * t viciously . 
 and just like that , i was cumming , wailing as my pu ** y convulsed around his fingers , waves of pleasure and pain making me soar to heights i did n't know i was capable of . 
 he went still inside of me , his fingers filling me as i squeezed tight with each pulse , flying on wings of ecstasy . 
 when i finally came back down to earth , he pulled his fingers out of me and jerked my skirt back down . 
 i turned around , breathing hard , in time to see him wiping his hand on his silk pocketsquare , avoiding my eyes . 
 he opened his bottom desk drawer and threw a white dress shirt at me . 
 one of his spares . 
 `` get out . '' 
 i caught it , my brow furrowing . 
 `` mr. drake ? '' 
 `` i said , get out . '' 
 the dangerous tone in his voice left no room for discussion . 
 i pulled the shirt around my shoulders and hurried out , buttoning as i went . 
 back at my desk , i tried to fight back the tears , without success . 
 what the hell had just happened ? 
 did he want me or not ? 
 had i disappointed him somehow ? 
 just when my fantasies were coming true ... i was n't good enough . 
 *** at the end of the night , as mr. drake left his office , he paused beside me . 
 i remained looking forward , responding to an email , not daring to speak . 
 what would i say if i did ? 
 a warm hand on my shoulder made me jump . 
 `` isabeau , i. . . '' 
 i looked up and was caught up again in those cool , green eyes . 
 for a moment , i thought i caught a hint of sadness behind them , but then it faded , his unreadable mask slipping back into place . 
 `` yes , mr. drake ? '' 
 `` what happened today ... it was wrong of me . 
 for a moment , i forgot myself . 
 you make me do that , you know . '' 
 he paused , looking me over , taking in his oversized shirt falling low over my pencil skirt . 
 `` do what ? '' 
 i asked , allowing myself a small smile . 
 `` forget myself . '' 
 he leaned down , and i heard him inhale , milimeters away . 
 was he smelling my hair ? 
 then , he straightened again , his back stiff . 
 formal . 
 like nothing had passed between us . 
 `` it wo n't happen again . 
 it ... ca n't . 
 i wo n't lose my temper again . 
 not with you . '' 
 he moved away , and i jumped out of my seat , following like a lost puppy . 
 `` but , why not ? 
 i do n't mind ! '' 
 he stopped by the elevators , hesitating before pushing the button . 
 `` i. . . 
 i liked it , '' i said , my voice barely a whisper . 
 a moment hung suspended before he finally moved , pushing the down button with a black , gloved hand . 
 `` i wo n't punish you again , isabeau . 
 not like that . 
 this was the first and last time . 
 please understand . '' 
 the doors slid open , and just like that , he was gone , sliding away from me into the night . 
 and i could do nothing to stop him . 
 i looked down at the ramen cup sticking out of my trashcan , and a thought struck me , lifting the cloud of confusion and despair threatening to settle over me . 
 maybe there was a way . 
 maybe i was a very bad , lazy , forgetful assistant after all . 
 maybe i just could n't help myself . 
 maybe i 'd just have to break his rules ... maybe then he would n't be able to help it , and would forget himself all over again . 
 i bit my lip and leaned back in the office chair , imaging him bending me over his desk , guiding his c ** k toward my eager sex . 
 i slipped a finger beneath my skirt , rubbing myself through my panties , wondering what it would feel like to have him inside of me . 
 my ass stung as i pressed back onto my wooden chair , and i moaned , remembering his sweet punishment . 
 i knew one thing for certain -- this was n't over between us . 
 not by a longshot . 
 i was his , after all , at his beck and call . 
 ready and eager for whatever he had to give me .
