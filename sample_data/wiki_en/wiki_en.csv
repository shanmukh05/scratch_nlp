"St John the Baptist's Church, Bretherton","St John the Baptist's Church is in the village of Bretherton, Lancashire, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Chorley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with that of St Michael and All Angels, Croston. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission.

History

St John's was a Commissioners' church costing £1,058 (equivalent to £ in ).  The Church Building Commission contributed £250 towards its cost.  It was designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe and built in 1839–40.  The land was given by George Arthur Legh Keck. The church provided seating for 400 people.  In July 1840 it was consecrated by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner, at that time the Bishop of Chester.  The church was restored in 1898 by Sharpe's successors Austin and Paley, who also added a chancel and vestry in 1908–09. In September 2009 the church was damaged by fire caused by an arsonist.

Architecture

The church is constructed in sandstone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave incorporating a south porch, and a two-bay chancel under a higher roof. The style of the nave is ""simple Gothic"", while that of the chancel is Perpendicular. At the west end is a slender tower, the lowest stage of which constitutes a porch that is open on three sides. Above this are three string courses, the top one of which is stepped over the bell opening. At the corners are buttresses that rise to form crocketted pinnacles. At the top of the tower between the pinnacles is a stepped parapet. A slim octagonal spire rises from the tower. The porch has an arched doorway over which is a lancet window. Its top is gabled and has a cross finial. The east window has five lights and Perpendicular tracery. Inside the church is a west gallery supported on four slim iron columns. The two-manual organ was built by Ainscough Organ Builders of Preston in 1929, and rebuilt and extended by David Wells of Liverpool in 2000.

External features

The churchyard contains the war grave of a Loyal Regiment soldier of World War I.

Wahid Omar,"Waheed Omar (Dari:وحید عمر) (born March 1978) is a politician in Afghanistan currently serving as President Ghani's Senior Advisor and Director General of Office of Public and Strategic Affairs. From 2016 to 2019 he served as Ambassador of Afghanistan to Italy. He was also Afghanistan's Permanent Representative to World Food Programme, International Fund for Agricultural Development, FAO and IDLO. Between 2009 and 2011 he served as Chief Spokesperson of President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai. He helped President Karzai win his second term as Communications Director of his reelection campaign in 2009. During the electoral campaign and the aftermath of the election he was often seen as Karzai's one-man frontline. Both President Karzai's supporters as well as his opponents recognized Waheed Omer's eloquence, civil debate skills, his equal fluency in Pashto and Persian, and his media-management skills. .

Before being a campaign spokesperson, Omar was the founding Director of the Government Media and Information Center, formed in 2009 to oversee communications between the government, Afghan citizens and the international community.

Biography
Waheed Omar was born and raised in Kabul as an ethnic Pashtun. His early schooling took place in Kabul and Peshawar, Pakistan. He later attended the University of York in the United Kingdom where he received a Master of Arts degree in political science. At York, Omar focused on Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development. His MA thesis was on South Africa's post-apartheid transitional justice mechanisms and how on how some of those lessons could be applied to post-war Afghanistan.

Before his appointment as Karzai's chief spokesperson, Omar served the Government of Afghanistan in several high-level positions, including as the deputy director of the Office of Administrative Affairs (2007–2008), and the chief organizing officer of the Af-Pak Peace Jirga. He also has worked with international and domestic non-government institutions such as the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, The Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung and Sanayee Development Foundation. Omar has been an activist and writer from a young age, establishing Afghan Youth Foundation for Unity in Peshawer when he was in his early 20s. He led the establishment of FES, Afghanistan Young Leaders Forum in 2003. He has published a children's book and several articles and poems in Dari, Pashto and English.

Omar speaks both of the official languages of Afghanistan, Persian and Pashto, as well as English, and is proficient in Urdu/Hindi and German.

1944 United States Senate election in North Dakota,"The 1944 United States Senate election in North Dakota took place on November 7, 1944. Incumbent Republican Senator Gerald Nye ran for re-election to his fourth term. He faced a serious challenge to his renomination in the Republican primary, with prominent Fargo attorney Lynn Stambaugh and Congressman Usher L. Burdick running against him. He won with one-third of the vote, defeating Shambaugh, his closest opponent, by fewer than 1,000 votes. In the general election, Stambaugh continued his campaign against Nye as an independent, splitting the Republican vote as Governor John Moses, the Democratic nominee, ran a strong campaign. Though Nye had benefited from crowded general elections before, he bled Republican support to Stambaugh and Moses unseated him with just 45% of the vote. However, just a few months into Moses's term, he died in office, flipping the seat back to Republican control and triggering a June 1946 special election.

FSV Union Fürstenwalde,"FSV Union Fürstenwalde is a German football club from Fürstenwalde/Spree, currently playing in the Regionalliga Nordost (IV). As with many East German clubs at the time, the club (or clubs) has (or have) a complicated history of formations, re-formations, ownership changes, legal changes, name-changes and mergers; however the lineage can be traced back as far back as 1919, with the current incarnation formed in 2002.

History
The roots of the club go back to SC Union 06 Oberschönweide Abt. Fürstenwalde, formed in 1919 as a section of Berlin-based SC Union 06 Oberschöneweide and adopted the name SC Union Fürstenwalde in 1927 after separating from the latter club. Union went through a number of name changes and merger after 1945 but eventually, in 1971, became SG Dynamo Fürstenwalde. Dynamo, affiliated to sports association SV Dynamo and associated with the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany, experienced some success at the second level of GDR football, the DDR-Liga. With the end of East Germany Dynamo was dissolved and Union reformed. In 2002 Union merged with Wacker Fürstenwalde to form the current club.

The club's recent rise through the league system began when it won promotion to the Brandenburg-Liga, the highest league in the state, in 2008. A championship at this level in 2011 took the club up to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord where it played until 2016, when another title there brought Union up to the Regionalliga Nordost for the first time.

BBC Choice Northern Ireland,"BBC Choice Northern Ireland was the national variation for BBC Northern Ireland of the BBC Choice service, that was broadcast by the BBC.

As with the local variants of BBC Choice in Scotland and Wales, BBC Choice Northern Ireland carried much of its content from the network BBC Choice service originating in London, but split off most evenings for around two hours a night (generally around 10pm to midnight) of local programming to Northern Ireland. When the EastEnders rebroadcast aired at 10pm, local programming would begin at 10.30pm. After around midnight, programming would revert to the network service until closedown.

The service was available on the ONdigital/ITV Digital terrestrial service and cable in Northern Ireland only, and on the Sky Digital satellite service across the UK – listed as channel 160 on Sky in Northern Ireland and at the rear of the programme guide elsewhere in the UK; this was as part of a system to allow the correct regional variant for the viewer's area to be accessed from the primary channel number.

The BBC Choice Northern Ireland service launched alongside the other BBC Choice variants on 23 September 1998 and ceased broadcasting on 30 March 2001; it was replaced by a fully networked BBC Choice. The channel was then itself replaced from 2003 by BBC Three, which has never had any regional variants. None of the BBC's other digital services offer variants (whilst BBC One HD currently offers a single UK-wide service based on the Network schedule, with local programme out-outs in Scotland, Wales, NI and the English regions currently available in SD only.)

Following the closure of BBC Choice's regional variants in 2001, BBC Two's variants for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were made available to digital viewers (previously a single UK-wide version of BBC Two had been available on digital platforms).

Following the closure of BBC Choice Northern Ireland in 2001, a 'digital version' of BBC Two Northern Ireland launched which was separate to that available on analogue; it carried many of the NI-specific programme opt-outs as on the analogue service, but also carried some additional digital-only programmes, in the main carried over from BBC Choice NI. This dual-service continued until October 2006, when it was decided to recombine the two BBC Two services for Northern Ireland into a single schedule, which is the service now available.

Cyclotetradecaheptaene,"Cyclotetradecaheptaene, often referred to as [14]annulene, is a hydrocarbon with molecular formula C14H14, which played an important role in the development of criteria (Hückel's rule) for aromaticity, a stabilizing property of central importance in physical organic chemistry. It forms dark-red needle-like crystals.

Structure and aromaticity 
Although the conjugated ring of this annulene contains 4n+2 electrons, it only exhibits limited evidence for being aromatic.  It does not fully conform to Hückel's rule because none of its cis/trans isomers can adopt a completely planar conformation due to crowding of the interior hydrogens. There is evidence that it has two isomeric forms of comparable stability (trans, cis, trans, cis, trans, trans, cis- with four interior hydrogens (shown in the infobox) and trans, cis, trans, cis, trans, cis, cis- with three interior hydrogens) which rapidly interconvert at room temperature but can be observed at low temperature by NMR.  Its 1H NMR spectrum shows evidence of aromatic ring currents that result in an upfield shift for the interior hydrogens.  In contrast, the corresponding [12]- and [16]annulenes, which are weakly antiaromatic or nonaromatic, have downfield shifted interior hydrogens.  However, unlike the undoubtedly aromatic [18]annulene, [14]annulene does not bear the hallmark aromatic property of chemical stability, and it quickly decomposes when exposed to light and air.

Ivan Plotnikov,"Ivan Vasilyevich Plotnikov () (1902–1995) was a Russian engineer and inventor of kirza, a type of artificial leather based on the multi-layer textile fabric, modified by membrana-like substances, a cheap and effective replacement for the natural leather. The material is mainly used in production of military boots and the belts for machinery and automobiles.

Plotnikov worked in the city of Kirov, at the Kirov plant or Kirovskiy Zavod, a fabric producing artificial leather. The name kirza is an acronym from Kirovskiy Zavod, which was the first place of the mass production of kirza.

The technology was invented in 1935 by Plotnikov and his fellow engineer Khomutov. The mass production began during the Winter War of the Soviet Union against Finland. Initially the material proved to be unfit to the winter conditions, and the production was halted. However, very soon the technology was improved and the mass production was resumed in the autumn and winter of 1941 during the German invasion of Soviet Union, since the large numbers of footwear were badly needed for the Red Army.

For the invention of kirza, Ivan Plotnikov was awarded the Stalin Prize the size of 100,000 rubles on 10 April 1942, as ordered by the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union.

Daniel of Erie,"Daniel of Erie (secular name Dmitry Borisovich Alexandrov, Дмитрий Борисович Александров; September 15, 1930 – April 26, 2010) was an American Russian Orthodox bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.

Life 
He was born in 1930 in Odessa, Soviet Union. Due to anti-Communist family connections, Dmitry's father, Boris Alexandrov, decided to move the family to Zlatoust in the Ural Mountains in 1938. Within just a few months of the move, Boris was arrested and disappeared; it was later found out he was executed. Mrs. Alexandrov then moved her family back to Odessa.

In 1944 they left westward with the fleeing German Army, and within two years found themselves living in the Alps. Thanks to family in the United States, the Alexandrovs were able to emigrate to America, and came to New York City in 1949. From 1952 to 1958, Dmitry studied at Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary (Jordanville, New York), finishing with the first graduating class, along with the future Metropolitan Laurus (Škurla).

From his early years, Dmitry Borisovich was interested in the pre-Nikonian ""Old Rite"" of the Russian Orthodox Church, and decided to work toward somehow healing the schism of the Old Believers.

In August 1965, he was ordained deacon, and soon afterwards, priest.

In 1988, he received the monastic tonsure and the new name of Daniel. On August 13, 1988, Hieromonk Daniel was consecrated a vicar bishop for the Diocese of Eastern America, with the title ""Bishop of Erie, Pennsylvania, Defender of the Old Rite"". The Church of the Nativity was his Cathedra; he played an integral role in reuniting the congregation with the Russian Orthodox Church. He was temporary administrator of the Diocese of Australia and New Zealand from 1995 to 1996.

Bishop Daniel died on April 26, 2010.

Basil Gill,"Basil Gill (10 March 1877 – 23 April 1955) was a British stage actor and film actor. His stage career included many roles in plays of Shakespeare.

Life
He was a son of the Rev. John Gill, of Cambridge.

His first stage appearance, in  Bury, Lancashire in 1897, was in The Sign of the Cross (Wilson Barrett's most successful play); the following year he appeared in this play in London. He then toured Australia and the USA with The Sign of the Cross and Ben-Hur.

In 1903 he joined Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company at His Majesty's Theatre, London, and appeared in plays of Shakespeare, playing several important roles. He left the company in 1907. He continued to perform, into the 1930s, in Shakespeare's plays during his career. As well as being a Shakespearean actor, he was regarded as a matinée idol and played romantic parts in modern plays.

His career as a film actor started with Henry VIII (1911): he appeared with Beerbohm Tree, on whose version of the play the film was based. In 1926, Gill appeared in two short films made in the De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film process, Santa Claus as the title character, and Julius Caesar as Brutus. He appeared in many more films, the last being The Citadel of 1938.

492nd Attack Squadron,"The 492d Attack Squadron is an active United States Air Force unit.  It is assigned to the 49th Operations Group, stationed at March Air Reserve Base, California.  It was reactivated on 15 April 2019.

The squadron's first predecessor was organized in 1917 as the 80th Aero Squadron.  It moved to France the following year, where it was redesignated the 492d Aero Squadron (Construction) and served as a support unit.  It returned to the United States, where it was demobilized in 1919.

The second predecessor of the squadron is the 492d Bombardment Squadron, which served in the Organized Reserve from 1925 to 1937.  It was consolidated with the Aero Squadron in 1936, but was disbanded along with other reserve units in May 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War II.

The squadron's third predecessor was activated in India in late 1942 as the 492d Bombardment Squadron.  It served in combay in the China Burma India Theater, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation.  After V-J Day, the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated at the port of embarkation.  A few months later, the squadron was reactivated as a Strategic Air Command bomber unit.  It served in the strategic bomber role until being inactivated in 1963, when its resources were transferred to another squadron.

History

World War I
The first predecessor of the squadron is the 80th Aero Squadron which was organized at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, on 15 August 1917. Early the next month the service nature of the unit became clearly apparent when it was redesignated the 80th Aero Squadron (Construction).

The squadron left Kelly Field on 28 October 1917, arriving at the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island on 3 November.  While at Garden City, the squadron was given intensive drill and training for service overseas.    It departed for the port of Hoboken, New Jersey on 22 November and boarded the .  The ship left port later that day, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 25 November.  It waited in Halifax for other ships to form a convoy for the Atlantic crossing, and arrived at Liverpool, England on 8 December.   From there, the squadron took a troop train south to a rest camp at Winchester.    With the exception of 30 men who were quarantined with sickness, the squadron left Winchester on 13 December and crossed the English Channel on the SS Mona's Queen, landing at Le Havre, France, on 14 December 1917.

After arriving in France the 80th Squadron took station at the Second Aviation Instruction Center at Tours Aerodrome. There it performed construction tasks  until the end of World War I.  Meanwhile, on 1 February 1918, it had been redesignated the 492d Aero Squadron (Construction). The unit returned to the United States aboard the USS Frederick late in January 1919 and was disbanded at Garden City on 13 February.

Inter-War years
The 492d Bombardment Squadron was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 31 March 1924, and assigned to the 349th Bombardment Group as part of the General Headquarters Reserve) and allotted to the Ninth Corps Area. Training began for reserve personnel in January 1925 at Sand Point Airport, Seattle, Washington.

The unit was consolidated on 5 December 1936 with the 492d Aero Squadron, in order to perpetuate the history and traditions of the World War I organization.  The consolidation of the two units under the bombardment designation thus served to extend the history of the reserve squadron back to 15 August 1917.

The unit conducted summer training at various locations including Rockwell Field, California, and Pearson Field, Washington. It was nactivated on 2 March 1937 at Seattle by relief of personnel.  It was disbanded on 31 May 1942.

World War II
Constituted as the active duty 492d Bombardment Squadron, 7th Bombardment Group, in 1942. The squadron was activated as a Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment squadron in the China-Burma-India Theater under Tenth Air Force at Karachi Airport, India.  The squadron immediately began preparations to enter combat. Personnel strength grew slowly at first. Yet by 1 February 1943, with 48 officers and 388 enlisted men, the squadron was considered a complete fighting unit. By that time it was equipped with eight B-24 Liberator aircraft, a number which ultimately grew to fourteen.

The squadron actually entered combat on 24 January 1943 when, operating from its base at Gaya Airfield, India, it bombed docks, shipping, and warehouses at Rangoon, Burma. That raid was followed early in February with an attack upon a railroad bridge at Myitnge. During the next five months the squadron participated in repeated attacks on enemy communications lines In central and southern Burma, particularly in the area around Rangoon.   The monsoon season, commencing in May 1943, slowed down combat operations.  In July 1943, however, the unit attacked enemy shipping in the far distant Port Blair in the Andaman Islands. During August it persistently harassed shipping lanes in the Gulf of Martaban from Rangoon down to the Andaman Islands. A significant mission for September was an attack upon the Syriam oil refineries on the river opposite Rangoon.

On 22 January 1944 the 492d Squadron took station at Madhaiganj Air Base, India. It began the second year of combat activities with continued efforts to destroy enemy-held communications into and within Burma by bombing bridges, docks and warehouses, locomotives and rolling stock, and railway marshalling yards on land, and cargo vessels and naval craft on the adjacent waters.  In mid-June 1944, after the beginning of the monsoon period, the squadron moved to Tezganon-Kurmitola, India, and for the time being ceased combat operations. Instead it began transporting gasoline across the Hump to the Fourteenth Air Force in China. The first cargo was flown to Kunming on 20 June. These operations continued until after the first of October.

For the greater part of December 1944, the squadron switched concentrated on destroying enemy stores. In December also a small component of the 492d Squadron left on six weeks of detached service in China. Based at Luliang Air Base, it engaged in hauling gasoline and other supplies to Suichwan Airfield and Liang-shan.

Early in 1945 the 492d Bombardment Squadron supported British ground forces in the region north of Mandalay and east of the Irrawaddy River.   After the fall of Rangoon on 7 May 1945 the 492d Bombardment Squadron moved to Tezpur Airfield, India, and once again took on the mission of airlifting gasoline over the Hump into China. Some six weeks were required to refit the heavy bombers as substitute cargo carriers. The first mission was flown on 20 June. The aircrews completed the allotted task by 18 September.

Six weeks later the squadron moved to Dudhkundi Airfield, India, and then to Kanchrapara on 19 November. It sailed from Calcutta aboard the  on 7 December 1945, and arrived at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, on 5 January 1946. The unit was inactivated at Camp Kilmer the following day.

Strategic Air Command

B-29 Superfortress operations
On 1 October 1946 the 492d was redesignated a very heavy bombardment unit, activated at Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas and assigned to the 7th Bombardment Group, of Strategic Air Command. It was not until the last week in October, however, that the squadron received its first contingent of troops, 59 officers and 328 enlisted men on assignment from the 327th Bombardment Squadron.  It then began a training program which was designed primarily for overseas operations. The squadron was equipped with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft until late in the summer of 1948.

In April 1947 the 492d Squadron engaged in three long-range missions. The first was as part of a mass formation flight from its home base to Los Angeles. Next it participated in a simulated bombing attack on Kansas City. Lastly, the squadron helped to provide an escort for President Miguel Alemán Valdés of Mexico in a flight from New Orleans to Washington, D.C., in May 1947.

The squadron spent a part of June and July 1947 on maneuvers in Japan. During August most of its B-29's joined others of its companion units (9th and 436th Bombardment Squadrons) on a nonstop flight to Anchorage, Alaska, to test the immediate mobility of the 7th Bombardment Group. Before returning to Fort Worth they engaged in flights that provided training in local approach procedures and in navigation. The following month the three squadrons deployed to Giebelstadt Air Base, Germany. While in Europe they flew several training missions in the central and southern parts of the continent.

B-36 Peacemaker operations
The squadron received its first Convair B-36 Peacemaker aircraft in June 1948. A few weeks thereafter it was redesignated a heavy bombardment unit. By January 1949 the squadron had completed the transition to the new bomber and had closed out its B-29 program. In March 1949 an aircrew assigned to the unit flew nonstop a distance of 9,600 miles (from Fort Worth to Minneapolis, Great Falls, Montana Key West, Denver, Great Falls, Spokane, Denver, and back to Fort Worth) in 44 hours. As reported, this was the longest recorded flight to that date in a B-36 bomber.

In August 1949 the 492d Squadron inaugurated for the 7th Bombardment Group a series of routine training missions to Alaska. During February 1950 the squadron participated with other bombardment units of the group in an operational readiness test which also involved flights to Alaska. For that purpose they deployed several
aircraft to Eielson Air Force Base. It served as a forward staging area from which simulated missions were directed against designated targets in the United States. In Hay 1950 the 492d Squadron provided one of two B-36'8 on a mobility mission to Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico.

On 17 July 1951 six aircraft and aircrews assigned to the squadron departed Fort Worth for Goose Air Base, Labrador, Canada. Thence they were dispatched on a navigation mission to Thule Air Base, Greenland.  On the return flight from Goose Bay to Carswell, they made simulated attacks on Tampa, Florida; Birmingham, Alabama; and Fort Worth. Another deployment to Goose Bay on a unit simulated combat mission followed in March 1954. Meanwhile, in December 1951 the squadron provided one of two heavy bombers of the 7th Bombardment Wing on a special mission to RAF Sculthorpe, England. The purpose of this deployment was to participate in a Royal Air Force navigation mission on a noncompetitive basis, to effect a mutual exchange of ideas with Royal Air Force personnel, and to compare techniques in target study and briefing.

In August 1954 the 492d Squadron participated in a 7th Bombardment Wing maneuver to North Africa on a simulated strike mission, flying non-stop the 4,600 miles to Nouasseur Air Base, French Morocco, which had been designated the post-strike headquarters.

B-52 Stratofortress operations
In December 1957 the entire 7th Bombardment wing began preparations for converting from the B-36 aircraft to the Boeing B-52F Stratofortress. Early in February, the wing officially became a B-52 organization. In January 1959 the wing attained a combat ready status in the B-52.

On 15 June 1959, less than six months after having completed the transition from the B-36 to the B-52 aircraft, the 492d Bombardment Squadron was reassigned to SAC's 4228th Strategic Wing and moved to Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi to disperse SAC's heavy bomber force.  It conducted worldwide strategic bombardment training missions and providing nuclear deterrent.

It was inactivated in 1963 when SAC inactivated its MAJCON Strategic Wings, replacing them with permanent AFCON Wings.  The squadron's aircraft, personnel and equipment were transferred to the 736th Bombardment Squadron, which was simultaneously activated.

Unmanned vehicle training
The squadron was redesignated the 492d Attack Squadron and activated at March Air Reserve Base, California to train operators of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Pakistan's role in the War on Terror,"Pakistan's role in the War on Terror is a widely discussed topic among policy-makers of various countries, political analysts and international delegates around the world. Pakistan has simultaneously received allegations of harbouring and aiding terrorists and commendation for its anti-terror efforts. Since 2001, the country has also hosted millions of Afghan refugees who fled the war in Afghanistan.

Major developments

The Saudi born Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah, was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint U.S. and Pakistan raids during the week of 23 March 2002. During the raid, the suspect was shot three times while trying to escape capture by military personnel. Zubaydah is said to be a high-ranking al-Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al-Qaeda training camps.

Later that year on 11 September 2002, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was arrested in Pakistan after a three-hour gunfight with police forces. Bin al-Shibh is known to have shared a room with Mohamed Atta in Hamburg, Germany and to be a financial backer of al-Qaeda operations.

It is said Ramzi bin al-Shibh was supposed to be another hijacker in September 11 attacks, however the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rejected his visa application three times, leaving him to the role of financier. The trail of money transferred by bin al-Shibh from Germany to the United States links both Mohammad Atta and Zacarias Moussaoui.

On 1 March 2003, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was arrested during CIA-led raids on the suburb of Rawalpindi, nine miles outside of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. Mohammed at the time of his capture was the third highest-ranking official in al-Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the 11 September attacks. Other events Mohammed has been linked to include: ordering the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, the USS Cole bombing, Richard Reid's attempt to blow up a civilian airliner with a shoe bomb, and the terrorist attack at the El Ghriba synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has described himself as the head of the al-Qaeda military committee.

Amidst all this, in 2006, Pakistan was accused by NATO commanding officers of aiding and abetting the Taliban in Afghanistan; but NATO later admitted that there was no known evidence against the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) or Pakistani government of sponsoring terrorism.

The Afghan government also accuses the ISI of providing help to militants, including protection to the Mullah Dadullah, Taliban's senior military commander killed in 2007, a charge denied by the Pakistani government. India, meanwhile continues to accuse Pakistan's ISI of planning several terrorist attacks in Kashmir and elsewhere in the Indian republic, including the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings, which Pakistan alleges is due to ""homegrown"" insurgencies. Many other countries like Afghanistan and the UK have also accused Pakistan of State-sponsored terrorism and financing terrorism.

The upswing in American military activity in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan corresponded with a great increase in American military aid to the Pakistan government. In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately $9 million in American military aid.

In the three years after, the number increased to $4.2 billion, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11. Such a huge inflow of funds has raised concerns that these funds were given without any accountability, as the end uses not being documented, and that large portions were used to suppress civilians' human rights and to purchase weapons to contain domestic problems like the Balochistan unrest.

In December 2016, The Spectator reported that Pakistan is winning its war on terror. The article reported the major steps taken by the Nawaz Sharif, during his third term as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, which has resulted in an overall drop in violence.

The Guardian reported that in 2016, Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India referred to Pakistan as the ""mothership of terrorism"", as part of a reprised campaign to increase international pressure on Pakistan for allegedly harboring and supporting militant groups.

In August 2017, The Guardian reported that as part of a new US strategy in Afghanistan by the Trump administration, more pressure was to be put on Pakistan over alleged support for insurgent groups, with President Trump saying in a televised statement that ""we can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond."" The new strategy was supported by Afghan government officials, a spokesman for the Afghan president said that ""this is the first time the US government is coming with a very clear-cut message to Pakistan to either stop what you're doing or face the negative consequences."" Pakistani security officials rejected the statements, stating, ""They are shifting blame to Pakistan"" and ""Pakistan itself is the victim of terrorism. We are fighting militants and have conducted many ground and aerial operations and destroyed their sanctuaries. We want to eradicate them physically and ideologically."". As part of a regional approach, Trump said he would encourage India to play more of a role (whom are already providing economic and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan), former officials and analysts have pointed out that the fear of a greater Indian presence in Afghanistan was the justification used by Pakistan's military and intelligence leaders to maintain backing for Afghan militants, as a buffer against Indian influence.

Northwest Pakistan

In Northwestern Pakistan the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.

Training ground for European militants
In 2009, a politically unstable Pakistan emerged as a new global hub for anti-West militancy, but, because of the constant threat of US attacks, recruits were reportedly more likely to spend their time under instruction and in training than carrying out assertive action.  In his report on the matter, focusing on an alarming influx of European extremists, Reuters security correspondent William Maclean wrote,

He added that the matter was likely to surface in a meeting on 6 May 2009 between United States President Barack Obama, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the first-mentioned looking to bring an end to the employment of Pakistan's tribal zones as a launching pad for al Qaeda activity around the world.

"Analomink, Pennsylvania","Analomink is a section of Stroud Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania.

History 

The village of Spragueville was founded in 1848. It is about 5 miles northwest of Stroudsburg. It was known for the manufacturing of sprags (or spragues).  At the time, the wood sprags were widely used in coal mines to lock the wheels of mining cars to prevent rolling. The term sprag was also applied to the prop used to support the roof of a mine. It was from the local production of sprags that the village's name is believed to have evolved. About a year after the founding of Spragueville, the post office reportedly began operations, presumably with the Analomink name.

Nearby were Analomink Creek (known today as the Brodhead Creek) and Analomink Waterfalls, more recently known as the Penn Hills falls.

Throughout the years, the name Analomink (meaning ""tumbling water"" in the local American Indian language) was associated with the village of Spragueville, but a town with two names caused confusion. At this time, the village was a stop on the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W). In 1901, residents sought to change the name of their village to conform with the name of its post office. It took about five years to have the town's identifier changed to Analomink. Spragueville was used unofficially for a time after the transition.

Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus (consul 478 BC),"Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus is the reconstructed name of the consul suffectus who replaced Gaius Servilius Structus Ahala as consul of the Roman Republic in 478 BC. The fact of Servilius' death is not recorded by Livy (who only mentions Servilius when he takes the fasces), nor by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (who states that Servilius campaigned against the Volscians, but had no success). However the Fasti Capitolini states that Servilius died in office and was replaced by a man most of whose name is obliterated except for the cognomen ""Esquilinus"".

In discussing the identification of this consul suffectus, T. Robert S. Broughton notes that Bartolommeo Borghesi suggested the name may be ""Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus"", while Cichorius suggested his gentile name may be Sergius, which is often confused with Servilius. Cichorius also points out that the space on the Fasti Capitolini would not fit the entire name and filiation as Borghesi proposed. However, Broughton favors Verginius, assuming his name on the Fasti Capitolini included only his possible father in the filiation, Opiter Verginius Tricostus, the consul of 502 BC, and only one cognomen.

Regardless of these speculations, it is likely that Opiter Verginius existed and held the fasces at some point in the 5th century. In another passage, Livy names him as the colleague of Lucius Aemilius Mamercus, consul for the third time in 473 BC, while admitting other sources name Vopiscus Julius Iulus. The filiation of the unfortunate consular tribune of 402 BC, Lucius Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus, is recorded on the Fasti Capitolini as including one Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus who would have lived in the 470s BC.

Elijah Bentley,"Elijah Bentley (fl. 1799–1814) was a Baptist minister and office holder from Upper Canada who pursued a variety of vocations including farming. He became important to Canadian history because of his trial for sedition during the War of 1812.

Elijah's father had brought an extended family to Upper Canada from the United States in search of homesteads and a new life. Elijah obtained at least one land grant in the Markham area. He, and other non loyalist Americans came under the scrutiny of Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore during a bi-election for Robert Thorpe in 1807. Gore considered the settlers like the Bentleys to have ""brought the very worst principles of their own constitution with them.""

George W. Cave,"George W. Cave is a CIA operations officer and authority on Iran who took part in the Iran-Contra arms sale.

George Cave majored in Middle Eastern studies at Princeton University, where he studied from 1952 to 1956, and joined CIA after graduation. One account claims Cave served for the CIA in Teheran during the 1953 Iranian coup d'état that restored the Shah of Iran to power. In the mid 1970s he served in Tehran as deputy CIA station chief, with personal ties to the Shah. His ""pseudo name"" was ""Adlesick"". In the series ""Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den"" he is referred to in volumes 10, 17, 38, 55 and 56. In October 1979, he gave a briefing to Abbas Amir-Entezam and Ebrahim Yazdi, based on intelligence from the IBEX system, that Iraq was preparing to invade.

By 1977, when he was working in Jeddah, he had six children, three of whom were in college.

He testified against Clair George about the CIA's involvement in Iran-Contra.

He published his first novel, ""October 1980"" in December 2013. In his final interview Duane Clarridge, former CIA operations officer and Iran-Contra figure, hinted that this novel was a largely accurate depiction of how Reagan's October Surprise transpired.

The International Spy Museum interviewed him about his career in June 2012.

He attended Milton Hershey School where he graduated in 1947 and was named Alumnus of the Year in 2001.

"Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo","The Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo (MDC Guaynabo) is a United States federal prison facility in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico which holds male and female inmates of all security levels who are awaiting trial or sentencing. It is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice.

MDC Guaynabo is located next to Fort Buchanan U.S. Army base, and is  west of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico.

In the wake of the destruction of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, some 1200 federal prisoners were transferred from Guaynabo to the Federal Correctional Institution, Yazoo City in Mississippi.  Those 1200 were returned to Guaynabo in the first quarter of 2018, along with other prisoners who had been temporarily held in Atlanta, Georgia, Talladega Alabama, and Miami, Florida.

Notable incidents
In 2010, an FBI investigation uncovered a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, heroin, marijuana, Percocet, and Xanax to an inmate at MDC Guaynabo. Several conspirators, led by Juan Rios-Ortiz, also attempted to provide cellular telephones, chargers, and SIM cards to an inmate of MDC. Rios-Ortiz worked for a company that had a contract to supply produce to the prison kitchen. Rios-Ortiz was subsequently convicted of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution of controlled substances, and providing contraband to an inmate of a federal prison.

On February 26, 2013, Osvaldo Albarati, a lieutenant for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, was shot and killed in what is believed to be retaliation for his investigations into cellphone smuggling at MDC Guaynabo. He had just left the facility and was driving home when several gunmen opened fire on his vehicle on the De Diego Expressway near Bayamon.  Albarati worked in the investigative branch at the prison, where he was responsible for investigating crime within the prison, including drug smuggling and illegal cellphone use. Authorities have said his killing may have been contracted by powerful drug kingpins being held at the facility in reprisal for recent seizures he spearheaded. The FBI investigated the killing and no charges were filed.

On March 24, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prison reported that it was operating on a modified schedule and inmates were not allowed visitors.

Murder of Heather Rich,"The murder of Heather Rich is an American child murder case dating from October 1996 in which a 16-year-old high school student from Waurika, Oklahoma, was sexually assaulted, raped, then shot to death before her body was thrown into a creek in Montague County, Texas.

Three teenagers (two of whom had been known to Rich) were arrested two weeks after the discovery of her body; each of the three were later tried and subsequently convicted of Rich's murder. One of the perpetrators was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole; a second individual was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment plus 99 years for conspiracy to commit murder, while the third individual was sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole after 40 years.

Conflicting testimony delivered at two of the perpetrators' separate trials leads to ongoing speculation as to which of the trio actually shot and killed Rich.

Early life
Heather Rose Rich (January 19, 1980October 3, 1996) was the third of four children and only daughter born to Gail and Duane Rich.

Heather was an avid horse rider and a talented musician, and has been described by her family as ""a naive girl with a big heart."" She was an academically successful sophomore who was popular with her peers at Waurika High School.

According to one of her friends, despite her façade of ebullience, Rich was a ""very troubled"" teenager, and she began to exhibit troublesome behavior both at home and at school in the late summer and early fall of 1996. Her classmate and former boyfriend, 17-year-old Randy Wood, stated this emotional behavior largely stemmed from Rich's restlessness at the fact Waurika held few amenities to entertain the town's youth. On September 27, she and another girl had been temporarily suspended from Waurika High School and the Waurika Eagles cheerleading team for their being noticeably drunk upon the sidelines of a school cheerleading performance. The duration of this suspension was just three days, and she was expecting to be a potential candidate to be the sophomore class homecoming queen of Waurika High School on October 11.

October 2, 1996
At approximately 11 p.m. on the evening of October 2, 1996, Rich left her home without her parents' knowledge to meet a 17-year-old Waurika High School senior named Joshua Bagwell in a trailer parked at the rear of the home of Bagwell's grandfather. Bagwell had already been drinking heavily with his friends, 19-year-old Curtis Gambill and Rich's former boyfriend, Randy Wood. One of the trio had earlier telephoned Rich to suggest she join them at Bagwell's trailer that evening. Shortly after Rich arrived at the trailer, both Wood and Gambill left Rich and Bagwell alone for approximately one hour, believing that as this was their first date, the two wished to be left alone. When Wood and Gambill returned to the trailer approximately one hour later, both Bagwell and Rich were naked, and a bottle of gin had been half consumed. Rich was extremely drunk, later being described as largely insensible; Bagwell later claimed the two had engaged in consensual sex. According to Wood's later trial testimony, the three youths, themselves intoxicated, began goading each other to sexually assault Rich while she was naked and largely insensible.

Wood then proceeded to sexually assault Rich (digitally penetrating her) before Gambill himself engaged in unconsensual sex with the semi-conscious girl. Shortly after Gambill had raped Rich, she partially roused out of her semi-conscious state and began moaning, screaming and crying.

Murder
Reportedly fearing the girl would accuse the trio of rape, Gambill then decided to kill Rich and, with a measure of force, successfully persuaded Bagwell and Wood to assist him in the commission of this act. According to Wood, Gambill pointed his shotgun at him and ordered him to dress Rich before he and Bagwell carried her into Bagwell's grandfather's pickup truck. Bagwell then began to drive in a seemingly aimless manner around southern Oklahoma for in excess of an hour as Gambill repeatedly exclaimed they would have to kill her before driving to desolate property his grandparents owned as a potential murder location. Gambill vetoed Bagwell's choice of a murder location, stating this location could easily be traced to the trio. Gambill then chose to drive the truck; driving towards a cement bridge upon a rural road in Belknap Creek, Texas.

At this location, Gambill retrieved his shotgun from the vehicle as he ordered Bagwell and Wood to ""get her out and put her on the side (of the road)."" Bagwell and Wood then carried Rich towards the bridge, where Gambill proceeded to shoot her several times in the head and torso with the shotgun as she lay upon the ground. Wood later claimed that he had sat inside the pickup truck as Gambill approached Rich with the shotgun in his hand; he had then covered his face with his hands before hearing ""the first shot...then I heard a bunch more."" He then climbed from the truck to observe Gambill appearing ""dazed at what he'd done."" Joshua Bagwell then took one of Rich's shoelaces and used this item to secure a rock to weight her body.

Rich's body was then thrown over the guard rail into the creek below before the trio attempted to conceal the extensive bloodstains at the precise murder scene by kicking and throwing soil across the ground.

Discovering that their daughter's bed had not been slept in and that all her possessions were untouched, yet that her bedroom window was open, Gail and Duane Rich reported their daughter missing to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department the following day. Despite the fact that Rich had not taken any of her personal possessions with her, when police learned from Gail that Heather had recently argued with her mother over a $300 phone bill for which she (Heather) had largely been responsible for the accrual, investigators initially assumed Rich had likely temporarily ran away from her household to stay with friends, and would likely return home within hours. Aghast, Gail responded: ""When your daughter is missing, you can stay at home!"" She and her family then began making their own inquiries around Waurika for information as to Rich's whereabouts. They subsequently hired a private investigator to assist in the search for their daughter.

Autopsy
Rich's body was discovered partially submerged in the Red River by a rancher and his daughter on October 10. Due to a combination of decomposition and the sheer number of shotgun wounds she had received, including the fact she had been shot once in the back of the head, her face and body were largely unrecognizable. Thus initially, her body was tentatively identified by her father via his recognizing a gold signet ring Heather had received as a present for her 16th birthday. Her body was later officially identified via dental records.

The autopsy of Rich's body revealed she had been shot nine times with an M-9 Winchester shotgun, with pellets from the buckshot rounds fired also hitting her body in several locations. One of these shots had been fired into the back of her head, with the remaining eight rounds being fired into her lower back, waist, pelvis and buttocks. In conjunction with the pattern of the bloodstains discovered at the preliminary crime scene, the trajectory of the shotgun wounds indicated Rich had most likely been shot as she lay face down, with her death being almost instantaneous.

Funeral
The funeral of Heather Rich was conducted on Monday, October 14, 1996, at the Praise Assembly of God Church in Comanche County. She was laid to rest in Fletcher Cemetery. As her murderer or murderers had neither been apprehended or convicted at the time of the service and with her family strongly suspecting her murderer(s) had not been strangers to her, Rich's family forbade any individual outside her immediate family from touching her coffin throughout the service, with her mother stating that prior to the service, she had promised her only daughter that ""whoever did this to her would never touch her again.""

Perpetrators

Curtis Allen Gambill
Curtis Gambill was a high-school dropout. He was born on February 24, 1977, and at the time of Heather Rich's murder, he was living with his 64-year-old grandmother in Terral, Oklahoma. Gambill was known to possess a short temper, and to exhibit sadistic features, being known to have regularly forced boys to fight each other in his presence upon the threat that if they did not do so, they would otherwise have to fight him. He had previously escaped from every youth detention center in which he had been incarcerated, and had been briefly committed to a psychiatric hospital at age 17. In addition, he had been convicted of feloniously carrying a firearm in February 1996; receiving a five-year suspended sentence.

In the week prior to Rich's disappearance, Gambill was notably depressed due to his best friend, 20-year-old Dennis Goss, having committed suicide on September 25. Just days prior to October 2, he and his close friend, Joshua Bagwell, had attended Goss's funeral.

Joshua Luke Bagwell
Joshua Bagwell was born on December 21, 1978. His parents were among the wealthiest landowners in southern Oklahoma, although as his parents' employment led them to be largely absent from home, he had lived with his grandparents since the age of 16. Bagwell was a senior at Waurika High School, and by October 1996, had been the recipient of six new cars. He was variously described as being a snobbish and pampered youth, although he was considered somewhat of an outcast among his peers. He and Gambill had formed a mutual friendship, in part due to their shared interests in firearms, drinking, camping, and fishing. Occasionally, the pair traveled to the environs of Belknap Creek for camping and fishing trips.

Undisciplined at home, Bagwell had once been arrested for driving while intoxicated, and had demanded a lawyer while resisting arrest. Both Randy Wood and Heather Rich had been impressed by Bagwell's affluent means; the latter commenting on more than one occasion that she had flirted with Bagwell until she had secured a seat in his white Dodge Stealth for the forthcoming Waurika homecoming parade. On the night of October 2, Rich had sneaked from her parents' home to meet Bagwell for what was supposed to be their first date.

Randy Lee Wood
Randy Wood was born on July 7, 1979. He and his single-parent mother had frequently relocated throughout Oklahoma during his childhood—frequently resulting in him having to attend numerous different schools. By 1996, Wood lived with his mother in a largely dilapidated house, and his family was known as one of the poorest in Waurika.

Wood began smoking cannabis in the third grade, often stealing the money or the narcotic itself from his mother. Despite his personal disadvantages, Wood endeavored to better himself among his peers, and by 1996, was the captain of the Waurika High School football team, having earned the respect of the entire team. He and Heather Rich had dated for approximately five months, during which they had regularly attended church together and conversed on the phone, although their relationship, despite being an intimate one, had never resulted in sexual intercourse, and the two were frequently mistaken as simply being friends. Having heard a rumor Rich had skinny-dipped at a party, Wood chose to end their relationship, although the two remained close friends.

One week after Rich's body was found at Belknap Creek, Randy Wood was crowned homecoming king of Waurika High School.

Investigation and arrests
A total of 14 investigators were assigned to investigate Heather Rich's murder. The investigation was assisted by the FBI in the event federal kidnapping charges could be brought against the perpetrator or perpetrators should Rich have been transported across state lines against her will.

Initially encountering a wall of silence from much of Waurika's youth as to Rich's potential whereabouts, by the second week of the inquiry, investigators focused more closely on a potential lead provided by Rich's best friend on the cheerleading squad that Rich may have left her home to attend a party at the home of a classmate of theirs named Joshua Luke Bagwell. Upon informal questioning, Bagwell initially claimed he and a friend of his named Randy Wood (both of whom had earlier been questioned by Gail Rich as to her daughter's whereabouts) had not seen Heather Rich on October 2 as they had been playing dominoes and drinking whisky and beer in his trailer until approximately 6:00 a.m. the following day. Wood corroborated this statement.

Having discovered that the buckshot rounds fired from the Winchester shotgun which killed Rich were of a distinct brand, investigators soon learned that only one store in Waurika had stocked this brand. Conversing with the owners of the store, these investigators discovered that just days prior to the murder, 20 rounds had been purchased by one Joshua Bagwell. The owner of this store was also able to positively identify Bagwell from an assembled police lineup. Furthermore, an employee of this store was adamant that at the time Bagwell had made this purchase, he had been in the company of another young male.

Further discovering that Bagwell had spent much of his time in recent months in the company of a 19-year-old high school dropout named Curtis Allen Gambill, and had regularly hunted in his company, Curtis Gambill was arrested on October 24. He was questioned for a total of eight hours, and agreed to submit to a polygraph test pertaining to his potential culpability in Rich's murder. Gambill failed this polygraph test, and subsequently agreed to allow investigators to subject the shotgun he owned to ballistic fingerprinting to determine whether this firearm had been used to murder Heather Rich.

Discovering the results of the ballistic analysis of his shotgun indicated the firearm had been the one used to murder Heather Rich, and that the weapon was capable of firing nine rounds before requiring reloading, Gambill confessed to being a participant in Rich's murder, also naming Bagwell and Rich's former boyfriend, Randy Lee Wood, as participants in the murder. According to Gambill, Wood had been the instigator of the crime, and the actual murderer, with himself and Bagwell acting upon his (Wood's) instructions. Wood's actual motive, Gambill claimed, had been sexual jealousy due to the fact Rich had engaged in sex with Bagwell and not him.

Bagwell and Wood were also arrested on October 24. Bagwell refused to admit any culpability in Rich's murder; invoking his right to silence and refusing to submit to a polygraph test. Shortly thereafter, his family hired a team of high-profile lawyers to defend him. By contrast, Randy Wood willingly agreed to provide a written statement in which he confessed to his being a participant in the murder, although he was adamant Curtis Gambill had been the instigator of the entire crime, and the individual who had shot and killed Rich, adding that Joshua Bagwell had been a knowing and willing participant. Wood further claimed not to have actually believed Gambill was serious in his vocal intentions to murder Rich until Gambill had parked the pickup upon the Belknap Creek bridge. He also agreed to submit to a polygraph test to verify his version of events—the results of which fully corroborated his written statement.

Initially, all three individuals were charged with the kidnapping of Rich and denied bail in Oklahoma. All were subsequently formally charged with first-degree murder in Montague County, Texas on October 25.

The trials of all three defendants were held in Texas. Owing to the law of Texas, all three individuals were tried as adults.

Trials

Gambill
Curtis Gambill was brought to trial on October 15, 1997. He was tried in Fort Worth. Shortly after his trial had begun, Gambill accepted a plea bargain offered by Montague County district attorney Tim Cole, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to Rich's murder—admitting to being the individual who had physically taken her life—in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty. He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with a potential possibility of parole after 30 years. As part of his plea bargain, Gambill also agreed to testify against Bagwell at his upcoming trial.

Bagwell
Joshua Bagwell was brought to trial in February 1998. Prior to and at his trial, he refused to admit any culpability in her murder; claiming that his intercourse with Rich after Gambill and Wood had initially left the two alone in his trailer had been consensual; that he had later left his trailer prior to Gambill and Wood actually discussing killing Rich; and that he had ultimately believed the trio were simply driving Rich around in an effort to sober her up before returning her home. Furthermore, he stated that he was unaware of any actual plan to murder her.

At Bagwell's trial, Gambill reneged upon his own previous agreement with prosecutors; changing his story and reverting to his initial claims upon arrest. This testimony largely suited the portrayal of Bagwell by the defense; minimizing Bagwell's role in the murder and corroborating his own claims that Wood had committed Rich's murder.

Randy Wood had initially accepted a similar plea bargain to that previously offered to Gambill in exchange for his testimony at Bagwell's then-forthcoming trial. However, the evening before he was due to give evidence, Wood—against the vehement advice of his defense attorney—changed his mind and rejected the plea bargain, insisting he wished to testify against Bagwell without any preconditions despite being informed by his lawyer that he risked either a longer prison sentence or a potential death penalty if convicted.

On the third day of testimony, Wood testified under oath that Gambill had largely orchestrated the murder, had shot and killed Rich, and that Bagwell had been a full-knowing participant in the act.

The day after Wood delivered his testimony, Bagwell testified before the jury. He insisted he had not been present in his trailer when Wood and Gambill had discussed murdering Rich, and blamed Wood for her actual shooting. Bagwell added his conjecture that Wood's motivation for this act had been that he had been angry at Rich for earlier refusing to engage in intercourse with him (Wood). Bagwell finally claimed not to have been physically close to the actual crime scene at the time Rich had actually been murdered, but had walked away to urinate. He solely admitted to a limited role in refusing to disclose acknowledgement of the murder after the event. Despite this testimony, when questioned as to his witnessing the actual shooting of Heather Rich, Bagwell contradicted himself in his reply, claiming he had witnessed ""Curtis—sorry I mean Randy—lowering the gun.""

Joshua Bagwell was convicted of capital murder on February 14, 1998, and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. He was sentenced to a mandatory life term. He was sentenced to an additional 99 years for conspiracy to commit capital murder on February 17.

Wood
Randy Wood was tried for capital murder later in 1998. Against the advice of his attorney, Pat Morris, Wood declined another plea bargain offered prior to his trial; choosing to plead not guilty to Rich's murder, stating that although he was aware of the law of Texas, he had neither intended for Rich to be killed, and that he had not physically taken her life himself.

Wood was found guilty of capital murder on August 25, 1998. As the State did not seek the death penalty in his trial, he was automatically sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood will first become eligible for parole in 2036.

Aftermath
 Randy Wood requested to meet with Rich's parents prior to his own trial, to explain his actions on the night of their daughter's murder, the moral and legal reasoning behind his course of action regarding his testimony at the trial of Joshua Bagwell, and the legal vulnerability this had subjected himself to. Rich's parents agreed to this endeavor. In an televised interview, Wood stressed his regret regarding his actions in the early morning hours of October 3, 1996. Having asked for their forgiveness but stating upfront he did not expect to receive it, Gail Rich responded by stating she and her husband had forgiven him for the hurt he had caused them, but they could not forgive him for his role in their daughter's murder, adding, ""Only Heather can do that.""
 In 1999, Wood filed an appeal against his conviction with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas. In this appeal, he did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented at his trial, but contended that his attorney had been ineffective in his service; failing to request an initial instruction upon the potential lesser-included offense of murder, an erroneous introduction of the guilty or innocence plea phase of his trial, and his attorney's  failing to raise objection at this stage. This appeal was overruled on October 14, 1999.
 Joshua Bagwell also appealed his sentencing; his appeal was filed with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas in November 2000, arguing that because Rich had been unconscious when taken to the  Belknap Creek bridge, she could not move, and if unable to move, she therefore had no movements to restrain, and restraint of the victim is an integral component of kidnapping. As such, Bagwell contended, because the Texas Penal Code defines capital murder as ""a level of murder that requires a kidnapping component"", he could not be guilty of the level of murder for which he was convicted. This appeal was rejected on January 31, 2001.
 In January 2002, Curtis Gambill and Joshua Bagwell were transferred from state prison to the Montague County jail in order that Gambill could be additionally tried for conspiracy to commit murder. On January 16, Gambill was additionally convicted and sentenced to a second, cumulative, term of life imprisonment. He had earlier waived his legal right to a trial by jury.
 Curtis Gambill, Joshua Bagwell and two other inmates briefly escaped from the Montague County Jail in which all four were held in January 2002. All four escapees were arrested nine days later in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The four individuals had held a member of public hostage at an Oklahoma gas station, but surrendered to authorities after several hours.
 In 2009, a cousin of Randy Wood named Denise Horner initiated a campaign for a commutation of Wood's potential life sentencing. This campaign was endorsed and supported by the prosecutor at Wood's trial, Tim Cole, who was reportedly regretful that he had not tried Wood for the lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder. Nonetheless, when Cole approached Montague County district attorney in 2010, he was reluctant to consider the proposal. He later confirmed his decision to Denise Horner in 2011, stating that following his consultations with the Sheriff and District Judge, it had been ""my understanding from them that they are also unwilling to recommend a reduction of sentence.""
 In 2016, Randy Wood married a woman from New Zealand. The two had initially corresponded as friends, although they gradually formed a relationship after she traveled to Texas to meet him face-to-face. This woman—who wishes to remain anonymous—moved to Texas in 2018 in order to be closer to Wood. One of the motivations for her decision to relocate to Texas is her commitment to campaign for those under the age of 18 not to be tried as adults within the state. Although Wood's wife has stated that she hopes he will be released long before his initial parole eligibility date, she has stated she is committed to remain with him.
 All three perpetrators of Rich's murder remain incarcerated in different Texas prisons. Curtis Gambill is incarcerated at the John M. Wynne Unit in northern Huntsville; Joshua Bagwell is at the Barry Telford Unit in New Boston; and Randy Wood is at the James V. Allred Unit in Wichita Falls.

Are You in the House Alone?,"Are You in the House Alone? is a 1978 American made-for-television horror film directed by Walter Grauman and starring Kathleen Beller, Blythe Danner, and Dennis Quaid. The film is based on the 1976 novel of the same name written by Richard Peck. It originally aired on CBS on September 20, 1978.

Plot 
16-year-old Gail Osborne is a typical high school student with a passion for photography. Six months ago, she and her parents moved from San Francisco to a smaller town due to her father Neil's claim the city was too dangerous following a burglary. Gail, a high spirited romantic, initially started dating classmate E.K. Miller, but he broke off their relationship because Gail was unwilling to sleep with him.

Now, Gail is dating Steve Pastorinis, despite her overprotective mother's objections. After a while, she receives an anonymous letter which says: ""I am watching you"". Gail thinks the letter is creepy, but is convinced by her best friend Allison Bremer that it is a practical joke from some student. However, when another note is found saying, ""I know where you are I'm watching you you tramp I'm coming after you"", and phone calls from a strange man laughing in a creepy way. Gail decides to warn her principal, who informs her it could be the act of her current or former boyfriend, someone she's rejected or perhaps someone she's knows that's hanging around.

One day, Gail tries to tell her mother Anne about the stalking, but Anne is too busy to pay attention and blows Gail off. Therefore, Gail ditches school and heads to San Francisco to visit her father at work. There, she finds out her father has been fired. Back home, she confronts her mother with this, who demands her to keep silent so Neil will not feel ashamed. Gail realizes more serious matters are going on in her life and decides to no longer pay attention to the notes and phone calls. One day when she's late for class, there is another message sticking out of her locker. A black and white picture of herself that she took in photography class with the word ""RAPE"" all in red across her face.

One night, she is babysitting the children of Jessica Hirsch, who is dating Gail's teacher Chris Elden. She receives a phone call from her boyfriend Steve Pastorinis, and he asks if he can come over after work and spend time together. Gail, relieved, says yes, and he tells her he'll be there soon. The phone rings again, thinking it's Steve she answers, but it's the same stalker, laughing hysterically asking: Are you in the house alone? Afraid, Gail locks the door and windows all around the house.

Someone knocks on the front door. Excited to see Steve, Gail opens the door and sees it's Allison's boyfriend, Phil Lawver, who stopped by. Phil asks if Allison is around because she said she was going to come by, and Gail responds she isn't there. Phil then asks to use the phone to call Allison's house. Phil picks up the receiver and dials the number but then puts his finger on the receiving end to cancel the call, and then pretends to be on the phone with Allison's mother while pulling out a handkerchief wiping off the phone. Gail looks over and sees him wiping the phone and he looks back at her before dropping the phone on the ground.

He looks at her and says, ""I really had you fooled, didn't I?"" Gail lets out a sigh of relief figuring he was pulling a prank on her. Phil then says in a raspy creepy voice ""Are you in the house alone?"" Phil reveals that it wasn't a prank and that he's been stalking her and knows everything about her. He then attacks her, forces her onto the ground, and proceeds to rape her. Afterwards, he runs out of the house.

Due to the trauma, Gail is hospitalized and at first refuses to say that Phil raped her, knowing she won’t be believed. Instead, she claims it was all a blur. Another female officer comes in to ask if she can try to remember, and Gail continues to lie out of fear. The female officer leaves, but tells her that if she changes her mind, to call her at the station. She also mentions that if Gail doesn't give her a name, they have no case, and her attacker can do this to someone else. Fearing that some other girl might endure what she just went through, she tells the officer it was Phillip Lawver. Her father is outraged at Phil, but finds out they can not sue him because Phil's father is a close friend of the local judge.

Gail is eventually encouraged by her teacher Malevich not to be afraid any longer and she returns to school. There, she finds out another girl is receiving the same creepy notes. Determined to stop Phil, she attempts to catch him on camera. Phil, however, is onto her and attempts to beat her up, but is caught by Steve. In the end, Phil pleads guilty to assault but is not charged with rape. He has since disappeared, and one rumor has it he is in a boarding school in New Hampshire.

1808 United States House of Representatives elections in New York,"The 1808 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held from April 26 to 28, 1808, to elect 17 U.S. Representatives to represent the State of New York in the United States House of Representatives of the 11th United States Congress. At the same time, a vacancy was filled in the 10th United States Congress.

Background
17 U.S. Representatives had been elected in April 1806 to a term in the 10th United States Congress beginning on March 4, 1807. David Thomas had been elected New York State Treasurer in February 1808, and had resigned his seat, leaving a vacancy in the former 12th District. The other 16 representatives' term would end on March 3, 1809. The congressional elections were held together with the State elections in late April 1808, about ten months before the term would start on March 4, 1809, and a little more than a year before Congress actually met on May 22, 1809.

Congressional districts
After the U.S. census of 1800, New York's representation in the House was increased to 17 seats. On March 30, 1802, the New York State Legislature had re-apportioned the congressional districts, dividing New York County seemingly at random into two districts. After the election of one Democratic-Republican and one Federalist in 1802, the Dem.-Rep. majority in the State Legislature gerrymandered the two districts together in an Act passed on March 20, 1804, so that two congressmen would be elected on a general ticket by the voters of both districts, assuring the election of two Democratic-Republicans. On April 8, 1808, the State Legislature re-apportioned the districts again, separating the 2nd and the 3rd District, and creating two districts with two seats each to be filled on a general ticket: the 2nd and the 6th.

David Thomas had been elected in the old 12th District which had comprised only Washington Co., so the vacancy was filled by a special election held only in this county, while at the same time two representatives were elected on a general ticket in the new 6th District to which Washington Co. had been re-districted together with Columbia Co. and Rensselaer Co.

Due to the double-seat districts, there were then only 15 districts; the 16th and 17th were eliminated.

The 1st District comprising Kings, Queens and Suffolk counties.
The 2nd District (two seats) comprising New York, Richmond and Rockland counties.
The 3rd District comprising Orange and Westchester counties.
The 4th District comprising Dutchess County.
The 5th District comprising Ulster, Greene counties.
The 6th District (two seats) comprising Columbia, Rensselaer and Washington counties.
The 7th District comprising Albany County.
The 8th District comprising Clinton, Saratoga and Essex counties.
The 9th District comprising Montgomery and Schoharie counties.
The 10th District comprising Herkimer, St. Lawrence, Jefferson and Lewis counties.
The 11h District comprising Oneida and Madison counties.
The 12h District comprising Delaware and Otsego counties.
The 13th District comprising Chenango, Onondaga, Broome and Cortland counties.
The 14th District comprising Tioga, Steuben, Cayuga and Seneca counties.
The 15th District comprising Ontario, Genesee and Allegany counties.

Note: There are now 62 counties in the State of New York. The counties which are not mentioned in this list had not yet been established, or sufficiently organized, the area being included in one or more of the above-mentioned counties.

Result
9 Democratic-Republicans and 8 Federalists were elected to the 11th Congress, and one Democratic-Republican to fill the vacancy in the 10th Congress. The incumbents Mumford, Gardenier, Van Rensselaer and Thompson were re-elected; the incumbents Van Alen and Harris were defeated. 

Note: The Anti-Federalists called themselves ""Republicans."" However, at the same time, the Federalists called them ""Democrats"" which was meant to be pejorative. After some time both terms got more and more confused, and sometimes used together as ""Democratic Republicans"" which later historians have adopted (with a hyphen) to describe the party from the beginning, to avoid confusion with both the later established and still existing Democratic and Republican parties.

Aftermath and special election
Nathan Wilson took his seat in the 10th United States Congress on November 7, 1808.

The House of Representatives of the 11th United States Congress met for the first time at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., on May 22, 1809, and Emott, Fisk, Gardenier, Gold, Knickerbocker, Livingston, Nicholson, Porter, Sage, Sammons, Thompson, Tracy and Van Rensselaer took their seats on this day. Mathews took his seat on May 23; Mumford on May 24; and Root on June 7.

William Denning never took his seat, and resigned. A special election to fill the vacancy was held at the annual State election in April 1810, and was won by Samuel L. Mitchill, of the same party. Mitchill, a former U.S. Representative (1801–1804) and U.S. Senator (1804–1809), took his seat on December 4, 1810.

Coolidge Corner Theatre,"Coolidge Corner Theatre is an independent cinema in the Coolidge Corner section of Brookline, Massachusetts specializing in international, documentary, animated, and independent film selections and series.

History
Coolidge Corner Theatre was originally built as a Universalist church in 1906 and was redesigned as an Art Deco movie palace in 1933 as the community's first movie theatre. The theatre opened on December 30, 1933 with its first film being a Disney short film. Originally the theatre only had one screen but was later divided into two and then four.

In the 1980s, owner and operator Justin Freed thought that he could no longer compete with rising video sales and competition from other art houses. In 1986, the theatre was sold to a developer due to financial trouble and planned to be torn down or converted to commercial business. Harold Brown, a Boston real estate magnate living in Brookline, bought the whole building and leased the theatre to the Coolidge Corner Theatre Foundation in November 1989 for 99 years.

Comedian and Brookline, Massachusetts native John Hodgman worked at the Coolidge Corner Theatre in his youth.

Gumbaynggirr,"Gumbaynggir  (also ""Kumbainggar"", as pronounced by the first European settlers) are an Australian Aboriginal group on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales. The Gumbaynggirr Nation is from Tabbimoble Yamba- Clarence River to Ngambaa-Stuarts Point, SWR- Macleay to Guyra and to Armidale. The Gumbaynggirr have the largest midden-shell deposit in the Southern Hemisphere.

Language

Gumbaynggir is classified as one of the two Gumbaynggiric languages of the Pama–Nyungan family. In 1986 the Muurrbay Aboriginal Language and Culture Co-operative was established by Gumbaynggirr elders to revive their language and hand it on. Language classes began in 1997, and by 2010 some several hundred people had some partial grasp of the language.

Country
The Gumbaynggirr lands extend over an estimated  covering an area of the Mid North Coast from the Nambucca River to as far north as the Clarence River (Grafton), and eastward to the Pacific coast. Norman Tindale specified its limits as bounded by the lower course of Nymboida River, stating that the territory ran toward Urunga, Coffs Harbour, and Bellingen. It included South Grafton and Glenreagh. It took in the coastal strip south from near One Tree Point, Woolgoolga and Nambucca Heads. The thin coastal zone from Coffs Harbour to Evans Head was Yaygir territory.

To their north were the twenty groups speaking various dialects of the Bandjalang. The Jukambal were to their west and the Nganyaywana/Anēwan in the environs of (Armidale). Their southern boundaries met with those of the Djangadi and Ngamba.

History

Clement Hodgkinson was the first European to make contact with the local Aboriginal community when he explored the upper reaches of the Nambucca and Bellinger Rivers in March 1841. Three decades later, loggers began to work their way up through the Orara River cedar stands in the 1870s. Over c.1873-1874 J.W. Lindt produced photographs of local indigenous people both in their environment and conducting actual traditional ceremonies in the Clarence River district, and made portraits in his studio. Contemporary commentary records them as ""the first successful attempt at representing the native blacks truthfully as well as artistically."" The Sydney Morning Herald, of 24 November 1874 expanded on what made the photographs attractive to Europeans;

The report clearly sets out a cynical nostalgia for the traditional ways of these people made sentimental by noting their 'decreasing numbers', expressing a common attitude amongst the colonists that the indigenous populations were doomed. However, the individuals in Lindt's group portraits and their clans and languages (Gumbaynggirr and Bandjalung), are not named, the 'scenery' is generic, and the accessories not those of the people depicted.

In clearing the land, the loggers opened up the prospect of selectors to squat on the tribal territories in the early 1880s. Soon after, in that same decade, a shepherd was murdered in the area and a hunting party was dispatched to exact revenge, resulting in the Red Rock Massacre. The slaughter started at Blackadder Creek where the Gumbaynggirr were camping. Mounted troopers entered the camp and began shooting. Those who fled were tracked down to the Corindi Creek where more were shot. Those who survived were driven to the headland and herded off the rocks into the sea. The hunters kept shooting at the swimmers, but some hid in a cave and made their way to Corindi Lake further south. One of the survivors was the present day elder Tony Perkins' grandmother, who crouched down in a thicket of bulrushes with a child in her arms.

After a court battle lasting two decades, the Gumbaynggirr claim to much of the reserve around the site in 2014 was confirmed by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.

Many reserves and missions was established in NSW by the Aboriginal protection board this resulted in relocation of aboriginals from their once called ancestry homes to only to be returned to home location after years of trauma, the land they stood on was altered for Whitemans usage later on.

Culture
Muurrbay in Gumbaynggir means the white fig tree and plays an important part in the Gumbaynggir Yuludarla (Gumbaynggir Dreamings).

The Gumbaynggirr made sweets (bush lollies, called jaaning) by rolling tender shoots from the Acacia irrorata in the sap oozing from the tree.

 Giinagay (hello).
 Yaam darruy ngiina gaduyaygu (It's good to meet you).
 Yaarri yarraang. (goodbye).

Iodine monofluoride,"Iodine monofluoride is an interhalogen compound of iodine and fluorine with formula IF.  It is a chocolate-brown solid that decomposes at 0 °C, disproportionating to elemental iodine and iodine pentafluoride:

5 IF → 2 I2 + IF5

However, its molecular properties can still be precisely determined by spectroscopy: the iodine-fluorine distance is 190.9 pm and the I−F bond dissociation energy is around 277 kJ mol−1.  At 298 K, its standard enthalpy change of formation is ΔHf° = −95.4 kJ mol−1, and its Gibbs free energy is ΔGf° = −117.6 kJ mol−1.

It can be generated, albeit only fleetingly, by the reaction of the elements at −45 °C in CCl3F:

I2 + F2 → 2 IF

It can also be generated by the reaction of iodine with iodine trifluoride at −78 °C in CCl3F:

I2 + IF3 → 3 IF

The reaction of iodine with silver(I) fluoride at 0 °C also yields iodine monofluoride:

I2 + AgF → IF + AgI

Reactions
Iodine monofluoride is used to produce pure nitrogen triiodide:

BN + 3 IF → NI3 + BF3

Nepotianus (magister militiae),"Nepotianus (died 465) was a general of the Western Roman Empire.

Life 

Nepotianus married the sister of Marcellinus, the semi-independent ruler of Dalmatia; Julius Nepos, last Western Roman Emperor, might have been their son and did at some point succeed Nepotianus as ruler of Dalmatia.

In 458 he was comes et magister utriusque militiae and together with Aegidius, he commanded the army of the Western Emperor, Majorian. That same year Majorian started a military campaign to re-conquer Gaul; the army, reinforced by some barbarian mercenaries, dislodged the Visigoths of Theodoric II from Arelate and obliged them to return to their condition of foederati. With the help of his new foederati, Majorian entered in the Rhone Valley, conquering its populations ""some by arms and some by diplomacy"". He defeated the Burgundians and besieged and conquered the city of Lugdunum: the rebel city was heavily fined, while the Bagaudae were forced to join the Empire.

In 459, some envoys of Nepotianus and of the gothic comes Sunieric arrived in Gallaecia to announce the victory of Majorian and the treaty between the Romans and the Visigoths.

In May 460, Nepotianus and Sunieric led some troops in a joint attack with Theodoric to the Suebi: Nepotianus moved to Gallaecia and attacked the Suebic army, defeating it near Lucus Augusti.

At the beginning of the 460s, Nepotianus was deposed by order of Theodoric II, maybe because he opposed the powerful magister militum Ricimer, and was substituted by Arborius. He died in 465.

Jerry Roush,"Gerald Allen ""Jerry"" Roush (born November 15, 1986) is an American musician, best known as the former vocalist for Sky Eats Airplane, Of Mice & Men, and Glass Cloud. He has also volunteered as a substitute vocalist for American Me during their Japan tour.

Musical career

Sky Eats Airplane (2006–2009) 
After answering a national casting call to join the fledgling metalcore band, Sky Eats Airplane, Roush was announced as the permanent vocalist. He was in the band from 2006 to 2009, and was featured on their self-titled second studio album. After being in the band for almost three years, co-founder of Sky Eats Airplane, Lee Duck, announced that Roush would be leaving the band. Duck stated that the ""creative differences..."" between Roush and Sky Eats Airplane were ""the best option for everyone.""

Of Mice & Men, American Me (2010–2011) 
When Austin Carlile, lead singer of Of Mice & Men, was forced to refrain from touring due to heart surgery, the band asked Roush to substitute for Carlile while they played on Alesana's The Emptiness Tour. Roush was featured on the band's cover of ""Blame It"", originally performed by Jamie Foxx and T-Pain, which was released on the Fearless Records compilation album Punk Goes Pop 3.

Roush's membership with the band lasted several months until Alternative Press announced on January 3, 2011, that Carlile would be returning to Of Mice & Men along with collaborator, Alan Ashby. This had Roush without a musical project for little more than a month, until it was announced on Roush's Twitter that he would be filling-in on vocals for the band American Me on their tour in Japan.

Glass Cloud (2011–2015)
Roush eventually formed the band Glass Cloud with The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza guitarist Josh Travis, and announced that they would enter the studio by November 2011 to record their debut, full-length album expecting a release in March 2012. Glass Cloud announced on April 20, 2012 that their debut album, The Royal Thousand, would be released on July 3, 2012 and would feature the songs from their double single, ""White Flag"" and ""Counting Sheep."" It was eventually released on July 10, 2012.

Glass Cloud's second release, Perfect War Forever, was released on October 23, 2013.

Russia–Chechnya Peace Treaty,"The Russia–Chechnya Peace Treaty of 1997, also known as the Moscow Peace Treaty, was a formal peace treaty ""on peace and the principles of Russian-Chechen relations"" following the First Chechen War of 1994–1996. It was signed by the president of Russia Boris Yeltsin and the newly elected president of Chechnya Aslan Maskhadov, on May 12, 1997, in the Moscow Kremlin.

Events
The 1997 agreement was preceded by the Khasavyurt Accord signed by Maskhadov, then the chief of staff of Chechen separatist forces, and the Russian general Alexander Lebed on August 30, 1996, which had formally ended the war in Chechnya with the withdrawal of all federal forces and administration, and thus the return to uneasy status quo of 1991–1994. During the often-tense subsequent talks, the Russian negotiating team was headed by Ivan Rybkin, Lebed's replacement in the post of chief negotiator, and Boris Berezovsky and their Chechen counterparts Movladi Udugov and Akhmed Zakayev. In January 1997, Russia officially recognized the new Chechen government of president Maskhadov, paving the way for his meeting with Yeltsin. Shortly before flying off to Moscow, Maskhadov persuaded a renegade commander Salman Raduyev to cease his agitation and provocations against Russia.

In the short treaty the two sides agreed to reject ""forever"" the use of force or threat of force in resolving disputed issues, and to build bilateral relations the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria ""on the generally recognized principles and norms of international law."" Besides Maskhadov and Yeltsin, former Chechen acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev also took part in the signing, together with Zakayev and Udugov, and several Russian top government officials. According to Yelstin, this was a ""peace deal of historic dimensions, putting a full stop to 400 years of history [of conflict between Russia and Chechnya]"". It was then complemented by a longer intergovernmental economic agreement signed the same day by Aslan Maskhadov and the Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, including the heated issue of how much Russia would pay the devastated republic in war damages.

The Moscow treaty caused great jubilation in Chechnya, but the key issue of independence was not resolved. According to the Khasavyurt Accord, all agreements on the relations between the Grozny and Moscow should be regulated until the end of 2001, however in 1999 Moscow nullified the peace treaty after the invasion of Chechen Basayev forces to the neighbouring Russian republic of Dagestan. The Russian forces invaded the breakaway republic again, occupying its whole territory by the next year. In 2003, Russia created the new constitution for Chechnya, according to which the Chechen Republic is one of federal subjects of the Russian Federation. Maskhadov has been killed by Russian special forces in 2005 while calling Moscow for negotiations to end the Second Chechen War. The increasingly radicalized Chechen separatist movement evolved into an interethnic, pan-Islamic militant network, and in 2007 its originally nationalist goal of an independent and secular Chechnya has been officially abandoned in favor of an unified Islamic state encompassing most of Russia's North Caucasus.

Lasiopetalum baueri,"Lasiopetalum baueri, commonly known as slender velvet bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae and is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It is a small, greyish shrub with more or less linear to narrowly oblong or narrowly elliptic leaves and groups of white or pink flowers.

Description
Lasiopetalum baueri is a greyish, densely foliaged, spreading shrub  high and  wide, its new growth prominently covered with red-brown hair. The leaves are linear to narrowly oblong or narrowly elliptic,  long and  wide on a petiole  long, the margins flat or turned downwards. Hairy below, they become smooth above over time. The flowers are arranged in sometimes crowded groups of two to six with three bracteoles  long at the base. The sepals are  long and usually pink or white with a green base, the outer surface densely covered with star-shaped hairs. The petals are less than  long and the anthers are reddish-brown and about  long. Flowering occurs from September to November and the fruit is a densely hairy capsule  in diameter.

Taxonomy
Lasiopetalum baueri was first formally described in 1806 by Joachim Steetz in Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae from specimens collected by the botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer. The specific epithet (baueri) honours the collector of the type specimens.

Distribution and habitat
Slender velvet bush is found in southern South Australia, central and western Victoria, and southwestern New South Wales where it is confined to the vicinity of Rankins Springs, and in the north-east of Tasmania. It grows in mallee communities or coastal cliffs on sandy soil over limestone, the top layer of soil often neutral to acidic, while the subsoil is highly alkaline.

Conservation status
This lasiopetalum is listed as ""rare"" under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

Use in horticulture
Lasiopetalum baueri can be readily grown in dryer climates in well-drained soils and sunny aspects, and is used as a windbreak or hedge. It responds well to being pruned. It was introduced into cultivation in England in 1868. The dried flowers are long-lasting and have potential as a cut flower.

St Osyth's Priory,"St Osyth's Abbey (originally and still commonly known as St Osyth's Priory) was a house of Augustinian canons in the parish of St Osyth (then named Chich) in Essex, England in use from the 12th to 16th centuries.  Founded by Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, , it became one of the largest religious houses in Essex. It was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul as well as St Osyth (Osith), a royal saint and virgin martyr.  Bishop Richard obtained the arm bone of St Osyth from Aylesbury for the monastic church and granted the canons the parish church of St Osyth.

The foundation began as a priory, probably populated first by canons from Holy Trinity, Aldgate.  The first prior of St Osyth's was William de Corbeil, who was elected archbishop of Canterbury in 1123 and who crowned King Stephen in 1135. The priory was converted into an abbey in the mid-12th century.

In Gesta pontificum Anglorum, William of Malmesbury spoke in praise of the piety and learning of the canons at St Osyth's in the twelfth century. One of the second generation of canons there was William de Vere, later bishop of Hereford, who wrote a Latin Life of St Osyth, in which he mentions that his mother Adeliza, daughter of Gilbert fitz Richard of Clare, had been a corrodian at the abbey for twenty years of her widowhood.

A charter of King Henry II confirmed the right of the canons of St Osyth's to elect their abbot and to hold a market every Sunday at Chich in the later 12th century.

During the Suppression of the Monasteries, the religious group was dissolved by King Henry VIII in 1539, at which time there were a prior and sixteen canons.  The king granted it to his minister Thomas Cromwell, but on his fall from favour, the abbey and its estates were returned to crown possession.  In the reign of King Edward VI they were sold to Sir Thomas Darcy for just under £400.  The gatehouse, dating from the late 15th century, is the most significant remnant of the original monastic structures still standing. The exterior is a fine example of decorative flint work. It stood in for St Anselm's theological college in the BBC's miniseries adaptation of P. D. James' Death in Holy Orders in 2003.

Five parts of the priory are Grade I listed buildings.

Stratford Career Institute,"Stratford Career Institute (SCI) is a distance education school established in 1991 that offers at-home vocational training programs to students in North America. Stratford's corporate offices are located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with a U.S shipping/mailing office in St. Albans, Vermont.

Stratford offers more than 60 distance education courses with correspondence by mail, the Internet, or in combination. SCI markets its courses for the purposes of ""personal development"" to learn or improve skills that can be used to seek employment in a particular field or for personal enjoyment.

In February 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against the school. The FTC alleged that the Institute was misleading consumers about its high school program, which the FTC said failed to meet the basic requirements set by most U.S. states. SCI settled those claims in 2017, agreeing to cease making false claims about its programs, notify students that they could cancel their high school program enrollment, and not pursue debts owed by students for that program.

Accreditation
Stratford Career Institute does not hold any regional and national  educational accreditation that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or any Canadian accreditation agency.

Ceratobasidium,"Ceratobasidium is a genus of fungi in the order Cantharellales. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are effused and the genus is sometimes grouped among the corticioid fungi, though species also retain features of the heterobasidiomycetes. Rhizoctonia-like anamorphs of Ceratobasidium species are placed in the genus Ceratorhiza. Species are saprotrophic, but several are also facultative plant pathogens, causing a number of commercially important crop diseases. Some are also endomycorrhizal associates of orchids.

Taxonomy
Ceratobasidium was introduced in 1935 by American mycologist D.P. Rogers to accommodate species of the old form genus Corticium that showed affinities with the heterobasidiomycetes. These affinities were the possession of large sterigmata (""Cerato-basidium"" means ""horned basidium"") and the production of basidiospores that produce secondary spores.  Four species were originally placed in the genus, with subsequent authors adding a further 35 species.

Current status
Research on the septal pore ultrastructure of the little-known and atypical type species, Ceratobasidium calosporum, indicates that it is a member of the Auriculariales and is unrelated to other species of Ceratobasidium. This taxonomic problem has not yet been resolved. Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, places Ceratobasidium (excluding the type species) within the Cantharellales.

The genus Ceratorhiza
Many Ceratobasidium species produce anamorphic hyphal states, sometimes with sclerotia, that were originally placed in the form genus Rhizoctonia. With a move to a more natural classification of the fungi, the new genus Ceratorhiza was introduced for anamorphs of Ceratobasidium by R.T. Moore in 1987. Some ten species have been described in Ceratorhiza, several of which are not linked to any known teleomorph.

Description
Fruit bodies are effused, thin and often inconspicuous, smooth, waxy to dry and web-like, whitish to pale grey. Microscopically they have comparatively wide hyphae without clamp connections and basidia that are spherical to cuboid or broadly club-shaped. Basidia bear 2 to 4 sterigmata, which are comparatively large. Basidiospores are globose to cylindrical (elongated and worm-like in the type species), smooth, and colourless. They frequently produce secondary spores and germinate by hyphal tubes. Ceratorhiza anamorphs produce hyphae (sometimes swollen) and occasionally sclerotia (small propagules composed of thick-walled hyphae).

Habitat and distribution
Species are mainly saprotrophic, occurring in the soil and producing fruit bodies on dead stems and plant detritus. Some occur on attached leaves and stems. Several species have been isolated from orchid mycorrhiza. Distribution appears to be cosmopolitan.

Economic importance
Ceratobasidium species are opportunistic parasites of plants, causing a variety of economically important diseases. Examples include: Ceratobasidium cereale, the cause of sharp eyespot of cereals; Ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae, the cause of aggregate sheath spot of rice;  and Ceratobasidium noxium, the cause of kole roga or black rot of coffee.

Osama (name),"Osama (, ), alternatively Ausama and Usama, is an Arabic masculine given name.

The name derives from the Arabic stem اسم A-S-M Alif Sin Mim ""name"" and means more or less the one with a name and is one of many Arabic male given names for ""lion"", the lion being considered as an animal with fame. From this point of view sama is equivalent of the Latin name augustus, ""majestic"". In Hebrew the root is reduced to שם from Proto-Semitic *šim-, from Proto-Afroasiatic *(ʔi-)sim- (""name""),  each denoting some aspect of the animal. In popularity, the name has declined drastically since 2001, mainly due to negative associations with al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden.

List of Hot Country Singles & Tracks number ones of 1996,"Hot Country Songs is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music songs in the United States, published by Billboard magazine.  In 1996, 28 different songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles & Tracks, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on weekly airplay data from country music radio stations compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems.

The first number one of the year was ""Rebecca Lynn"" by Bryan White, which moved into the top spot in the issue dated January 6 and remained in place for only a single week before being replaced by ""It Matters to Me"" by Faith Hill.  Canadian singer Shania Twain had the most number ones in 1996, topping the chart with ""(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!"", ""You Win My Love"" and ""No One Needs to Know"".  The three songs spent a total of five weeks at the top of the chart, tying Twain for the most weeks at number one by an artist with George Strait, who spent two weeks in the top spot with ""Blue Clear Sky"" and three with ""Carried Away"".  Alan Jackson, Patty Loveless and Bryan White were the only other acts to have more than one number one in 1996.  The longest unbroken run at number one in 1996 was three weeks, which was achieved by seven different songs.

The final number one of the year was ""One Way Ticket (Because I Can)"" by LeAnn Rimes, which was the teenaged vocalist's first number one in the U.S.  It would, however, prove to be the only country chart-topper for Rimes,  whose career has fluctuated between country and pop.  Other artists to top the chart for the first time in 1996 were Martina McBride with ""Wild Angels"", Deana Carter with ""Strawberry Wine"",  Lonestar with ""No News"", and Rhett Akins with ""Don't Get Me Started"".

Francis S. Symondson,"Captain Francis Stanley Symondson  (27 March 1897 – 1 May 1975) was a British World War I flying ace credited with 13 confirmed aerial victories. He survived over three years of ground warfare and overcame early setbacks as a fighter pilot on the Western Front to become an ace in Italy.

Early life
Symondson was born in Sutton, Surrey, the second of three sons born to Stanley Vernon Symondson, a ship broker, and his wife Jesse Kate (née Uridge). The census of March 1901 found him boarding in Margate, Kent. Symondson first flew before the war in a Bleriot aircraft with Frank Goodden in June 1914.

World War I service
Symondson served three and a half years in the infantry before transferring to the Royal Flying Corps. He first served as a trumpeter in the Honourable Artillery Company, before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 25th (County of London) Cyclist Battalion, The London Regiment, on 18 March 1915. He later transferred to the Glamorgan Yeomanry (Welch Regiment), and was serving in Egypt when he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, in which he was appointed a Flying officer on 23 May 1917. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July.

He was posted to No. 29 Squadron in France on 4 September 1917. He crashed three of the squadron's Nieuports in the next 16 days, and was sent back to England for further training. He was then posted to Italy to join No. 66 Squadron as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 7 March 1918, he set fire to a kite balloon at Chiarano for his first victory. It was the beginning of a string of a dozen enemy losses, as Symondson destroyed another balloon and ten aircraft by 28 August 1918. On 15 September, he drove down an Austrian-Hungarian Berg D.I out of control for his thirteenth win. The following day, his Military Cross was gazetted. The citation read:
Lieutenant Francis Stanley Symondson, Yeomanry and Royal Air Force.
""For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. In two months he destroyed five enemy machines and one enemy kite balloon.""

In November 1918 he was awarded the Silver Medal for Military Valour by the Italian government.

Symondson's victories included an observation balloon set on fire, another destroyed, two Albatros D.V fighters shot down in flames, seven other opposing fighters destroyed, an enemy reconnaissance aircraft destroyed, and another driven down.

List of aerial victories

Inter-war career
Symondson was transferred to the RAF unemployed list on 6 June 1919. He was briefly restored to the active list as a flying officer for temporary duty between 9 April and 5 June 1921. On 26 June 1924 Symondson enlisted in the Territorial Army, losing his right to retain his RAF rank.

By 1929, he was married to Betty Symondson; she was named to probate a will on 17 June 1929.

He remained a recreational pilot throughout the 1930s. He was both entrant and pilot of the Gypsy Moth G-AARU during the King's Cup Race in June 1930, but dropped out of the event en route. He competed in the same event the following year, flying the same aircraft, sponsored by the Royal Aero Club. He was placed as high as fifth place at one point. A month later, in July 1931, at the opening of Plymouth airport, he also flew aerobatics for His Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales. Symondson flew in Jubilee Week during May 1935. As late as 1938, he was still flying and stunting a Gypsy Moth at an altitude of only .

World War II
On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain's declaration of war on Germany, Symondson was commissioned into the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, serving as a flight lieutenant until finally resigning his commission on 21 June 1943. He then served in the Air Transport Auxiliary into late 1945.

Francis Stanley Symondson died in Bridport, Dorset, on 1 May 1975.

Große Aue,"The Große Aue (in its upper reaches known as the Aue and then also the Neuer Mühlenbach or Mühlbach) is an , southwestern, left tributary of the River Weser in northern North Rhine-Westphalia and central Lower Saxony in Germany.

Course 
The Große Aue rises at a height of  as the Aue on the southern side of the Wiehen Hills in the village of Dono in the parish of Rödinghausen in North Rhine-Westphalia. After one and a half kilometres it turns north and from its confluence with the Nordbach, which joins it from the west at Schwenningdorf, is known as the Große Aue. It crosses a water gap in the Wiehen Hills, losing 40 metres of height and powering two mills, so that in the section through the Wiehen crest it has been named the Neuer Mühlbach (""New Mill Stream"") after the Neue Mühle (""New Mill"") at Schwenningdorf. Further downstream near Fiegenburg it collects a tributary from the west which drains the entire  (Eggetal), and is then known as the Mühlbach (""Mill Stream""), powering the mill at Gut Grollage, east of the Egge in front of the main crest of the Wiehen Hills. 
At Bad Holzhausen it loses the name Mühlenbach. Here the Große Aue reaches the North German Plain. At 10.6 kilometres it passes under the Mittelland Canal. On the western edge of Espelkamp (65 kilometres) in the river meadows on the far side of the dyke, two small lakes have been laid out: the Großer Auesee and the See am Kleihügel. The river continues north, passing Rahden to the west, to Preußisch Ströhen (northernmost village in Rahden borough), here it picks up the waters of the Großer Dieckfluss, before crossing the border into Lower Saxony. Here the valley is part of the 'bog belt' (Moorgürtel). Between kilometres 62.8 and 58.8 the Großer Aue flows in two parallel channels, of which one has been straightened, the other is the first part of a renaturalised route. Through Wagenfeld-Ströhen the Großer Aue runs to Barenburg. It flows eastwards through the southern part of the  Sulingen Gap and is then forced south by the geest hills of the Steyerberg Forest. Beyond Steyerberg it turns towards the northeast and reaches after a few kilometres the Weser Depression, on whose western edge it flows through Liebenau, in order five kilometres later near Binnen, half way to Nienburg, discharging into the River Weser. Its total length is about .

Renaturalisation 
After everything had been done in the years after the Second World War to turn the Große Aue into a canal-like river and thereby to create a flood-free river channel, initiatives during the 1980s in the Minden-Lübbecke region led to the decision to renaturalise the landscape. The intent was to enable the area, which had lost many of its native plant and animal species, to recover. A habitat was to be created to support riparian woods, hedges and plants and animals typical of the area.
                                                                                      
When the first cut of the spade for the renaturalisation took place in 1989 this project was unique in North Rhine-Westphalia. The monotonous river bed and riverside strips of land up to 300 m wide were turned into near-natural pastureland again. About  of flood plain was created. The artificial water channel was largely retained, but parallel to it a new river course was laid out which ran along the old route in several places. Today it is clear that a rich animal and plant world has been created without the risk of major flooding.

Fauna and flora 
A valuable habitat has been generated on the Große Aue for plants and animals typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large marsh grasshoppers. Threatened dragonflies, such as the banded darter, southern emerald damselfly live here as do birds like the whitethroat and little grebe. Reed buntings, reed warblers and snipe also occur here.

The near-natural grassland and wet meadows in the upper reaches of the river near Rödinghausen are under nature conservation protection. The nature reserve has an area of  and is known as the Aubach Valley Nature Reserve (NSG Aubachtal). Particularly valuable are the rich wet meadows and pastures with their sedges and reed beds.

Tributaries 
Its tributaries include the Flöthe and the Kleine Aue (""Little Aue""), that join it from the east, and the Großer Dieckfluss, which flows westwards, and merges into the Großer Aue at Preußisch Ströhen, at

"St Mary's Church, Slaugham","St Mary's Church is an Anglican church in the village of Slaugham in Mid Sussex, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex.  The 12th- and 13th-century church, restored in the Victorian era, serves a large rural area of the Sussex Weald, covering three villages (each with current or former chapels of ease of their own) as well as the ancient settlement of Slaugham.  It also controlled the church in the market town of Crawley—now one of the area's largest towns—for the first few centuries of its existence.  A locally important family built a private chapel in the church in the 17th century, and a series of memorials to deceased family members are considered to be excellent examples of their type.  English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance.

History
By the time of the Norman Conquest, the historic county of Sussex was divided into six areas called rapes, each based on a town with a castle. One such division was the Rape of Lewes, which covered a large part of eastern and central Sussex bounded (clockwise from the north) by Surrey, the Rape of Pevensey, the English Channel coast and the Rape of Bramber. The parish of Slaugham, long from north to south but narrow, followed the western boundary of the rape for a long distance.  Its manor and village existed in the 11th century: although not mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086, it was held by William de Warenne's Lewes Priory by 1098 (and possibly from as early as 1091), in common with many manors and estates in central Sussex.

William de Warenne and his wife Gundred supported the construction of churches in the Rape of Lewes, and may have founded a church at Slaugham. No trace of any 11th-century building remains, though, and the existence of a church at that time is a matter of conjecture.  The present structure is presumed to be built on top of its foundations. The oldest parts date from the early 12th century and consist of the north wall, a single doorway and other fragmentary remains in the nave, and the font. A chancel would have been built at that time as well to make a simple two-cell church, but no 12th-century fabric survives: it was rebuilt in the early 14th century.  Earlier, in the late 13th century, the first stage of the tower had been added at the west end of the church.  Its simple entrance door in the west wall is chamfered. The chancel arch, also 13th-century and unusually broad, similarly has chamfering to the walls of the nave. The 13th-century layout of the church was completed when a two-bay south aisle was built in about 1290.  It was connected to the nave by means of an unusually wide arcade with chamfered arches.  A single lancet window was inserted in the west wall.

The simple layout was gradually added to over the centuries.  The east window in the chancel, in the Decorated Gothic style, dates from the early 14th century. Buttresses were added at the northwest and southwest corners of the tower a century later; and in the 16th century, two square-headed windows were added to the north wall of the nave, flanking the blocked Norman doorway. A major change came in 1613: William Covert, a member of the family who had held the manor of Slaugham since the late 15th century, built a private chapel (the Covert Chapel) on the south side next to the chancel. Its main feature is a memorial of ""exceptional quality"", considered one of the best in Sussex: it depicts Richard Covert (who died in 1579) kneeling with seventeen other figures representing his wives, sons and daughters.  The first letter of each person's name is shown above their head.  The intricately carved stone wall-tomb has Corinthian columns, pilasters and a moulded frame, and a straight balustraded top section consisting of an entablature and frieze with carved flowers. Richard Covert himself wears a suit of armour, while his three adult sons have military dress.  Both wives are reading prayer books on lecterns.  At the top are three funeral helms, two of which bear versions of the Covert coat of arms.

Many churches in Sussex, including Slaugham's, were restored or rebuilt in the Victorian era. Some work had already been carried out on the south aisle in 1827—it was enlarged to hold an extra 200 seats— but most of the work was done between 1857 and 1860 by Gothic Revival architect Joseph Clarke. He added the top section of the tower, widened the south aisle further and removed most of the wall between it and the Covert Chapel (creating an archway instead), added a third bay between the chancel and the Covert Chapel, and built a vestry and organ chamber on the north side. In the west wall of the south aisle, a 13th-century lancet window remains, but Clarke added a rose window. Alterations continued later in the 19th century: a second vestry was built on the north side in 1879, the organ was moved again, and the tower was given a clock-face in 1881. A 17th-century pulpit was donated to the church and installed in 1890.

The churchyard is very large, reflecting the size of the parish. Burials include Catherine Matcham, one of Lord Nelson's sisters; and a table-tomb dated 1615 is one of the oldest such graves in Sussex. There are also wooden graveboards, sometimes used as a cheaper alternative to gravestones, and a pair of gate-like iron grave-markers. The lychgate at the north entrance was erected in 1903. A very broad yew tree, known to be over 600 years old, occupies part of the churchyard behind the church.

Eccentric and bad behaviour by clergy and parishioners was a common theme at Slaugham in earlier centuries.  Church attendance was made compulsory after the changes brought about by the English Reformation of the late 16th century, and especially in the early years detailed records would be kept of non-attendance or inappropriate behaviour in church. Ecclesiastical court records show that St Mary's Church was the scene of a violent crime in 1601, when Richard Woods was ""charged with breaking Thomas Mutton's head in the churche"" ; while on 29 June 1621 another man was found beating his wife instead of attending the Sunday service. In 1857, when Reverend Sergison was the vicar at St Mary's, a disagreement developed over some of the pews.  He overcame the problem by paying some boys to enter the church and burn the pews in question.  The half-crown bribe was successful in keeping his actions secret until after his death.

St Mary's Church was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 28 October 1957. Such buildings are defined as being ""particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest"". In February 2001, it was one of 54 Grade II* listed buildings, and 1,028 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Mid Sussex.

Architecture and fittings

St Mary's Church does not have a homogeneous external appearance and cannot be attributed to one era: the gradual change and growth of the building over the centuries is more apparent. The plan consists of a west tower with an entrance, chancel with a wide chancel arch, nave with an aisle on the south side, south (Covert) chapel next to the chancel, south porch, two vestries and an organ chamber. Sussex stone rubble is the main building material, although there is some ashlar as well (for instance in the walls of the Covert Chapel).  Slates and tiles, some of Horsham stone, are laid on the roofs.  The chancel roof retains a single 14th-century tie-beam but has otherwise been renewed.

The east window of the chancel is an early-14th-century lancet with three trefoils.  The exterior is hood-moulded.  The north wall of the chancel also has a lancet window: this has quatrefoils and ogee headings. The Covert Chapel has three windows, all with pointed-arched heads: that in the east wall has three cinquefoils (five-lobed lights), while the two in the south wall are simpler two-light windows. The nave's north wall has one 19th-century window flanked by two dating from the 16th century and the blocked Norman doorway.  All three are simple two-light windows with straight heads.  Two windows in the south aisle also date from the Victorian restoration, as does the single window in the west wall. Charles Eamer Kempe designed several stained glass windows for the church in the 1890s.

The tower rises in three stages, of which the lower two are local rubble and the upper (Victorian) part is of ashlar. The horizontal divide can still be discerned. Diagonally splayed buttresses were added at the northwest and southwest corners in the 15th century.  Only the lowest and highest storey have windows.  There is a single-light trefoiled lancet above the entrance and small round-arched windows in the side wall on the lowest storey; at the top the north wall has a clock and there are 19th-century lancets in the other three faces. This section also holds a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing.  There were originally five bells cast in 1773 by Thomas Janaway; two of these remain as the second and third of the present ring of eight, for which the other bells were cast in 1934 by Gillett & Johnston. The tower is topped by a pyramid-style tiled roof.

Memorials and monuments are the principal architectural feature of the church. As well as the 1579 memorial to Richard Covert (designed by a sculptor called Flynton at a cost of £30 (£ in )), the Covert Chapel has a  brass monument representing John Covert (who died in 1503); it sits below a brass canopy. In the chancel, a recess forms an Easter sepulchre containing brass monuments to an earlier Richard Covert (who died in 1546) and his three wives with a depiction of the Resurrection of Jesus, and next to it a memorial to his granddaughter Jane Covert in a columned surround topped with a pediment. Nelson's sister Catherine Matcham has a wall-mounted memorial in the east end of the chancel.

The interior had 12th-century wall paintings, a common feature of Sussex churches. These do not survive, but illustrations of the scenes (which represented the Passion) exist. One surviving feature from the 12th century is the square font of local marble, which now stands on a modern base but retains many original features including a carved fish design (unique in Sussex), arcades and tendril-style ornamentation. A 15th-century altarpiece was removed from the church and installed in St Laurence's Church in Goring-by-Sea near Worthing when that church was built in the 1930s.

Parish

Slaugham has always been a large parish: it covered  in 1940, most of which was sparsely populated Wealden countryside.  The three other villages in the parish—Handcross, Pease Pottage and Warninglid—each had their own chapel of ease for Anglican worship, controlled from St Mary's Church; the three buildings survive, but only one is still in religious use.

Handcross is a linear village of mostly Victorian buildings on the old London–Brighton road. All Saints Church, at  on the road to Horsham, is a small structure of red brick with a large, distinctive bell-turret at its west end. When the A23 London–Brighton road was diverted in the late 1950s to run past the village and widened at the same time, the church had to give up some of its land.  The tiny building now sits next to an overbridge and overhangs the bypass.

Warninglid, a hamlet with one main street, is  south of Slaugham in the south of the parish. Architect Francis G. Troup designed a basic chapel of ease for the community in 1935, about a century after one had first been suggested.  The cruciform structure was of brick and had some vividly coloured stained glass by J. Hogan of the firm James Powell and Sons, a long-established London-based stained glass company. The chapel, which cost £1,200 (£ in ) and had a tall vaulted interior lit by lancets, was sold in 2009, and Mid Sussex District Council gave planning permission for its conversion into a house. It stands at  on the road to Cuckfield.

Pease Pottage is a small village on the southern edge of Crawley, separated from it only by the A264 road.  A chapel of ease to St Mary's, later called the Church of the Ascension, was granted a licence in 1875.  The small Gothic Revival-style building, at , has been converted into an office.  It has multicoloured brickwork, a bell-turret and round-arched windows.

Crawley, north of Pease Pottage on the London–Brighton road, developed as a market town from 1202, when its market charter was granted.  It was just within the Rape of Lewes (the boundary with the Rape of Bramber ran up the middle of the London–Brighton road), and at first lay within Slaugham's parish. Soon after the market was founded, the long-established Poynings family were granted most of the land in the area by the descendants of William de Warenne; and by 1267, they had founded a chapel of ease at Crawley. It later became a chantry for the benefit of the Poynings family, members of which held the manor and lordship of Crawley until 1429 when the last descendant died. The church was later dedicated to St John the Baptist and opened for public worship in the growing town. It remained a daughter church to St Mary's Church at Slaugham until the 16th century, although in practice the relationship lapsed somewhat earlier and St John the Baptist's was effectively an independent parish church. St John the Baptist's Church is still the Anglican parish church of Crawley, and has Grade II* listed status.

The approximate north and east boundaries of Slaugham's present-day parish are the M23 motorway, part of the main railway line between Balcombe and Three Bridges, the B2110 road and the A23 road; on the south and west sides, field boundaries and minor roads form the border with adjacent parishes.

Hans Morten Hansen,"Hans Morten Hansen (born 28 February 1964 in Bergen) is a Norwegian stand-up comedian, and actor notable for holding the world record for longest stand-up performance since August 20, 2010. He also portrayed the character of Finn in the 2010 film Trollhunter.

Career 
Hansen began his career in 1993, and became a full-time performer two years later.  Failing to gain major success outside of his home town Stavanger as well as his place of residence, Oslo, he made a bet with the arrangers of Stand Up Festivalen (The Stand-up Festival), to make an attempt on the world record for longest stand-up performance. He began his record run on August 18, 2010, at 22:00 UTC, on Latter (Norwegian for laughter), a popular comedy club in Oslo. To beat the record, at the time held by Australian comedian Lindsay Webb, he would have to perform non-stop for 38 hours and 7 minutes. He was allowed a five-minute break every hour, as well as food and drinks on stage, and he was monitored by a doctor during the entire performance.  He was also required to remain upright during his entire performance, as well as not being allowed to repeat any jokes or bits more than once every four hours. His performance, which was shown live on the internet television service VGTV, had more than 1 million online viewers, as well as several thousand people in the audience during the 38-hour show.

On August 20, at 12:07 UTC, Hansen officially beat the record, and continued his performance for an additional seven minutes, setting the new world record at 38 hrs and 14 minutes. When it became clear that he had succeeded in beating the world record, several audiences members entered the stage to present him with flowers and champagne. He was praised by several fellow comedians for the feat, such as Atle Antonsen.

Disability hate crime,"A disability hate crime is a form of hate crime involving the use of violence against people with disabilities. The reason for these hate crimes are often due to the prejudice an individual or individuals have against that disability. It is viewed politically as an extreme of ableism, or disablism, and this is carried through and projected into criminal acts against the person with a disability. This phenomenon can take many forms, from verbal abuse and intimidatory behaviour to vandalism, assault, or even murder. Of these forms, the most common hate experiences are viewed through verbal abuse and harassment. Disability hate crimes may take the form of one-off incidents, or may represent systematic abuse which continues over periods of weeks, months, or even years. Parking places, wheelchair spaces, and other distinguished areas for those with disabilities to utilize, have become a target for enforcers of disability hate crime. These accommodations are somehow seen as an exclusion to the rest of the population, giving them a negative connotation and a reason for these violent encounters. The reasoning for disability hate incidents has had a continuous pattern all too familiar. Many of those with disabilities fall victim to these violent situations because they are seen as ""scroungers"", people that are falsely portraying their disabilities as a way to receive benefits, physical barriers, or simply as ""easy targets"".

Disability hate crime can occur in any situation and with any individual. Incidents may occur between strangers who have never met, between acquaintances, or within the family. The two key requirements for an act to be called a ""disability hate crime"" are that it is motivated in part or whole by prejudice against someone because of disability; and second, that the act is actually a crime.

Recognition
Sir Ken Macdonald, QC, the then Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, stated in a speech to the Bar Council in October 2008 that ""I am on record as saying that it is my sense that disability hate crime is very widespread. I have said that it is my view that at the lower end of the spectrum, there is a vast amount not being picked up. I have also expressed the view that the more serious disability hate crimes are not always being prosecuted as they should be. This is a scar on the conscience of criminal justice. And all bodies and all institutions involved in the delivery of justice, including my own, share the responsibility.""

Legal status
In the United States, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived disability.

In 1994, when the U.S. Congress reauthorized the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, crimes based on disability were categorized as bias crimes. This sparked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to begin keeping data that relates to all crimes based against persons, property, or society that entails someone with a disability. Once these crimes are recorded, they are then divided up into subcategories; therefore, disability status was measured out through either one's physical disability or their mental disability. The FBI did this in order to determine if the frequency of the crimes differed depending on one's disabled status (whether it was physical or mental).

The data they received indicated that the risk of a disabled individual being the victim of a hate crime was somewhat rare, but the risk of them being assaulted was far higher than any other marginalized group. However, there seemed to be a minute difference in terms of frequency between those who were physically disabled and those who were mentally disabled.

According to recent data, disability hate crime incidents are currently on the rise in the United States. There were over 150 recently reported hate crime offenses that stemmed from a bias of those with a disability just in the 2018 year. From the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, there were far fewer similar offenses in the year prior, demonstrating a stark increase as time has progressed. In total, the FBI reported over 7,000 hate crime incidents in general, which makes about 2.1 percent of the victims from those crimes specifically targeted because of their disability.

Out of the disability hate crimes that were logged and recorded, 110 of those were against people with mental disabilities, while the other 67 were those with physical disabilities. Studies have also shown that the chance of being physically or sexually assaulted when someone is disabled can be up to ten times greater than those who are able-bodied.

Regardless, there is a widely known assumption that the incidence of reporting crimes by someone with a disability is much less than that of other minority groups. Some suggest that this is the case because of the lack of access to the criminal justice system as well as possible retribution from caretakers or others. With that, individuals with disabilities may actually experience more hate crimes than those that have been reported.

In the UK, disability hate crime is regarded as an aggravating factor under Section 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, allowing a heavier tariff to be used in sentencing than the crime might draw without the hate elements. Section 146 states that the sentencing provisions apply if:
(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.

The test in Section 146 is deliberately one for evidence of 'hostility' rather than 'hatred' as the seriousness of the offense was considered to justify the application of a less strict test.

The Equalities Act of 2010, although allowing those to speak out when discriminated against, created a vulnerable category of people that consisted mainly of those with disabilities. It emphasizes the notion that those with disabilities can not leave their houses without being harassed and develops a divide between those who survive with disabilities and the rest of the world.

Crime recording 
The historical failure of police forces, prosecutors, and some social care organizations to treat disability hate crime as a serious issue, an echo of previous failures over other forms of hate crime, particularly racial and LGBT-focused hate crimes, has led to chronic under-reporting. This under-reporting is both pre-emptive, through a widespread belief within the disabled community that they will not be treated seriously by law enforcement, and post-facto, where police forces investigate the crime as non hate-based and record it as such. The National Crime Victim Survey completed in 2008 revealed that people with disabilities are twice as likely as those without disabilities to experience situations of violence. During this year, those with intellectual disabilities were at the highest risk for violence victimization.

Environments that struggle with deprivation are at higher risk for greater occurrence of disability hate crime. In southeast England, many with intellectual disabilities recall places such as schools, day centers, distant neighborhoods, and even forms of public transportation as areas ""where bad things happen"". Disability hate crime was stated as most prevalent in schools, colleges, and daycares.

It has been proven on multiple occasions that disability hate crimes are underreported due to police enforcement consistently making their own assumptions of the situation at hand and abusers perceiving impairments as vulnerability.

The UK Crown Prosecution Service's Annual Hate Crime Report, shows that 11,624 cases of racial or religious hate crime were prosecuted in England and Wales in 2009, with 10,690 leading to successful convictions. By contrast, only 363 prosecutions and 299 convictions were for disability hate crimes.

Through the years of 2012 and 2013, a crime survey among a large population of England and Wales had been completed. It was acknowledged that out of the estimated 62,000 disability-related hate crimes that happened during that time period, only 1,841 had been recorded by the police.

The UK charity Scope has conducted research into the prevalence and experience of disability hate crime, summarizing their findings and those of other disability groups in the report Getting Away With Murder   Katharine Quarmby, who wrote the report and was the first British journalist to investigate disability hate crime, has also written a book on the matter.

Perceived vulnerability 
The treatment of disability hate crimes has been affected by the perception of disabled people as inherently vulnerable. This is a multi-faceted issue. Unfounded application of the 'vulnerable' label to a disabled person is considered a form of infantilization, a type of ableism in which disabled people are regarded as childlike, rather than as functioning adults.

Perceptions of vulnerability can also lead to the perception that the victim is partially or entirely responsible for the crime. For example, a disabled person may be perceived as having been at fault due to being alone after dark, i.e., engaged in risky behaviour. This pattern of victim-blaming has also appeared in the prosecution of rape and other sexual crimes.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the vulnerability of victims is a key factor in all crimes. It has been applied to a wide variety of scenarios, including people working at night or handling large amounts of money.

The Crown Prosecution Service has issued guidance to its prosecutors reminding them that 'vulnerable' should only be used as a description of a person within the precise legal meaning of the term - for instance, as defined in section 16 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.

Psychological effects 
It has been long known that there are emotional and mental impacts on victims of hate crimes. In a British Crime Survey, data indicated that there is an elevated psychological damage to hate victims compared to non-hate crime victims. Research conducted in the US has indicated that the elevated damage includes anxiety, loss of confidence, depression, long-term post-traumatic stress disorder, and fear. Victims of bias-motivated hate crimes such as hate crimes against a disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity are more likely to experience these psychological effects than victims of crimes that are not motivated by bias. The following statistics, from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, show that hate crime victims:

 were 36% more likely to say that they were emotionally affected and more likely to be 'very much' affected than victims of crime overall
 were 44% more likely to say that they suffered a loss of confidence or had felt vulnerable after the incident than victims of crime overall
 were twice as likely to experience fear, difficulty sleeping, anxiety or panic attacks, or depression compared with all victims of crime.

Disability hate crimes composed of 1.6% of total reported hate crimes in 2017. A survey conducted in 27 countries reported that 26% of 732 people with schizophrenia interviewed reported experiencing unfair treatment in their personal security, which included physical or verbal abuse attributed to having a mental health diagnosis. 29% reported having been unfairly treated in their neighborhood. Furthermore, a survey conducted by mental health charity MIND reported that 50% of all respondents with mental health problems experienced harassment in the workplace or community. 71% of these respondents experience physical or sexual violence, theft, or mistreatment. People with learning disabilities or mental health problems within the disabled group were most likely to experience violence or hostility.

OPM's research report on violence and hostility against disabled people found that hate crimes have impacts that extend past the physical and emotional harm experienced by the victims. Family members who may not be disabled themselves can similarly be victimized. Furthermore, disabled people who may have not been a victim to a hate crime may restructure their lives in order to avoid putting themselves at risk. Members of the community in where the hate crime occurs often feel a sense of shame and anger. This same study found that people with learning disabilities found significant dissatisfaction with the way they have been handled by the police, stating that police officers were often felt to be 'patronizing' or 'rude' and did not know how to communicate with the victims in an appropriate manner.

Support 
Disability hate crimes leave affected or vulnerable individuals in need of support. There can be a multitude of efforts made towards showcasing support. Support can consist of emotional support, physical assistance, advice, guidance, and more.

There are some key tasks that are effective in supporting those impacted by disability hate crimes.

 Offering help to individuals vulnerable to hate crimes
 Efforts to lessen the impact that the abuse can make
 Empowering individuals to stand for what is right
 Do not shy away from intervening on the issues

As more hate crimes occur, the need for support increases. Support is more in demand when there are more victims of disability hate crime. Support will always be needed or in demand, but the amount that will fulfill is dependent on the amount of hardships and adversity that those in the disability community are facing.

Zona pellucida-like domain,"The Zona pellucida-like domain (ZP domain / ZP-like domain / ZP module) is a large protein region of about 260 amino acids. It has been recognised in a variety of receptor-like eukaryotic glycoproteins.  All of these molecules are mosaic proteins with a large extracellular region composed of various domains, often followed by either a transmembrane region and a very short cytoplasmic region or by a GPI-anchor.

Functional and crystallographic studies revealed that the ""ZP domain"" region common to all these proteins is a protein polymerization module that consists of two distinct but structurally related immunoglobulin-like domains, ZP-N and ZP-C. The ZP module is located in the C-terminal portion of the extracellular region and - with the exception of non-polymeric family member ENG - contains 8 or 10 conserved Cys residues involved in disulfide bonds.

The first 3D structure of a ZP module protein filament, native human uromodulin (UMOD), was determined by cryo-EM.

Additional copies of isolated ZP-N domains are found in the N-terminal region of egg coat protein subunits involved in fertilization in both vertebrates and invertebrates, such as human zona pellucida components ZP1, ZP2 and ZP4 and mollusk vitelline envelope receptor for egg lysin (VERL).

Dalziel High School,"Dalziel High School is a non-denominational secondary school in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The acting Rector is Jaclyn Martin.

Overview
Dalziel High School was founded in 1898. James K. Scobbie, Rector from 1957 until 1974, greatly enhanced the school's performance during his tenure. Since then, the school has received some of the best reports of any school in Scotland. The school was one of the first in the country to be awarded Charter Mark status (now Customer Service Excellence), as well as being awarded the National Award For Excellence for Work and Enterprise. On 11 November 2008, the secondary school was voted as the best in Scotland in a report by HMIe. Dalziel was also successful in winning the Customer Service Excellence award with no partial compliances and the highest standard of compliance plus, one of only a few schools in the United Kingdom to win this award.

The school motto is Summa Petenda (Aim for the highest).

The school has a specialised hearing impaired department, which caters to severely hearing impaired pupils from Lanarkshire and beyond.

Houses
The three school houses are Barclay, Colville, and Greig. Originally there were four houses: Avon, Brandon, Clyde and Douglas.

Feeder schools
The secondary school has many feeder schools, including Glencairn Primary School, Knowetop Primary School and Ladywell Primary School. Pupils from other schools near to Dalziel, such as Logans Primary School, usually get transferred to Braidhurst High School.

Sports
Dalziel School has its own playing fields, located at Dalziel Park, between the villages of Cleland and Carfin. The fields were proposed by the school's War Memorial Trust, and was to act as a permanent tribute to all the former pupils who died in the First World War and the Second World War. The playing fields were established through the purchase of the  Cleland Estate from the Colville family after the wars. Cleland Estate was also the venue for the annual Drama Festival. The estate was later redesigned to make it more compact and improve the quality of the pitches and this change was formalised when it was opened by the Princess Royal on 5 April 2001.

A handful of sports teams use these fields, some of which include the rugby club Dalziel (a club which was, for a number years, only for former pupils of the school), and the local SPL football team Motherwell, as well as a number of local athletics, tennis and hockey clubs. The Dalziel Park playing fields are regarded as one of the best in the country.

In February 2012, Dalziel was unveiled as a community sports hub.

Acteosaurus,"Acteosaurus is an extinct genus of aquatic lizard  that lived in the upper Cretaceous period. Its species, A. tommasinii and A. crassicostatus, were described in 1860 and 1993. Though A. crassicostatus is probably a junior synonym for Adriosaurus suessi, A. tommasinii was found to be similar to coniasaurs, mosasauroids, and a sister taxon to modern snakes in 2010.

Etymology
The primary portion of Acteosaurus name comes from Actaeon (; Greek: ), a famous Theban hero who was hunted and killed by the goddess Artemis. The second part of the name is the Greek word  (), which means ""lizard"" or ""reptile"". The type species was named after the botanist Muzio Giuseppe Spirito de Tommasini (1794—1879), the Podestà—or magistrate—of Trieste under the Habsburgs.

Taxonomy

As a genus, Acteosaurus was described in 1860 by German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer. There exist two known species of Acteosaurus: A. crassicostatus and A. tommasinii. The latter is the type species, while A. crassicostatus was discovered in 1993.

A 2010 redescription of the type species found ""monophyly of the clade Ophidiomorpha"". This included the Dolichosauridae, Pontosaurus, Aphanizocnemus, and Adriosaurus. Acteosaurus was found to be a basal ophidiomorph (similar to Adriosaurus) and sister taxon to the Ophidia, or modern snakes.

Description
Acteosaurus is described as slender or snake-like, similar to other dolichosaurids. Its shortened forelimbs and long tail help to distinguish it from other genera, and its vertebral column is similar to more modern varanid lizards.

The holotype, when it was discovered, was unfortunately missing its head. So, while Meyer was unable to come up with an exact number, he noted that Acteosaurus has at least 10 cervical vertebrae, and 27 dorsals. There are small articular processes on the trunk vertebrae, and it has long, narrow neural spines, and posteroventrally positioned, unfused haemal arches on the vertebrae of the tail. There is no pachyostosis, or bone thickening, in the vertebrae and ribs. The limbs are reduced in size, and though the forelimbs of Acteosaurus are fully developed, they are smaller than the hind limbs. Acteosaurus''' pelvic bone is flattened, has square-shaped pubic process, and a rectangular descending ramus.

Distribution and habitat

Both Acteosaurus tommasinii and A. crassicostatus were found in the upper section of karst Cenomanian platy limestone, in Komen, Slovenia. Komen is part of Istria, a peninsula on the Adriatic sea, and also a section of the Karst Plateau. During the late Cretaceous, most of Europe was an island chain in the Tethys ocean, and Acteosaurus aquatic nature and similarity to mosasauroids suggests that it lived on the coast of one of these islands.

Arthrocnemum subterminale,"Arthrocnemum subterminale (syn. Salicornia subterminalis) is a species of flowering plant in the Amaranth family known by the common name Parish's glasswort. This coastal and inland California native plant is a shrub that is found southerly into the northern states of Mexico, also in both coastal and inland areas, including salt marshes, alkali flats, and other habitats with saline soils.

As a halophyte, capable of growing in substrates with high salt concentrations, this glasswort is a perennial herb or subshrub growing in low clumps up to a meter wide mature plants having woody bases branching into fleshy, jointed green stems. The leaves appear as fused rings around stem, the tip of each individual blade narrowing to a point. The inflorescence is a fleshy, sticklike spike of minute flowers, each flower just a pocket made up of the joined sepals; there are no petals.

Bega rose to prominence with the songs Maca, Grl Zrbcnk, Pa faj, Dite dites, Silazhi, Kokashta, Papalove and Wawaz. He is best known for his eclectic approach to music, writing socially conscious lyrics with a satiric flare incorporated in a lyrical melody, combined with his tenor vocal range. He began performing in 2000, and became prominent initially with the song Silazhi.

Credited as Klevis Bega, he made his official film debut in the Albanian drama Pharmakon, as protagonist Branko. The role drew critical attention, and he was cast in various other projects since 2012, including Artan, Pa fan, Black Man and Amnesity.

Zizo is active in Albanian media as a television presenter as well. Bega frequently appears in the show Zone e lire, since 2012, Top Show Albania, since 2010, and since 2015 Thurje, where he discusses current international events and events in Albania. In Thurje recurring topics remain astrophysics and philosophy, two themes that interest Bega. In 2016 he had competed in the Albanian version of the widely popular reality show Your Face Sounds Familiar where he completed many imitations, such as Conchita Wurst, Lucio Dalla, Azis, Elita 5 and many others.

Personal life
Zizo resides in Tirana with his wife Era and two children, Dankan (born 2005) and Nia (born 2009). His son, Dankan, is the central subject of his 2014 release Papalove, in which Bega expresses his fatherly love to him. In 2020 he announced the birth of his third child, a boy named Dante.

Media panic,"Media panic is emotional criticism against a new medium or media technology such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, computer games or social media. Media panic  has a long history. At the end of the 18th century, print media were the subject of strong criticism in Great Britain for ""the poison continually flowing thro' the channel of vulgar and licentious publications"".

The Danish media scholar Kirsten Drotner defines media panic in the following way:
In some cases, debate of a new medium brings about - indeed changes into - heated, emotional reactions: in that case we have to do with what may be defined as a media panic. It may be considered a specification of the wider concept of moral panic, and it has some basic characteristics: the media is both instigator and purveyor of the discussion; the discussion is highly emotionally charged and morally polarised (the medium is either ""good"" or ""bad"") with the negative pole being the most visible in most cases; the discussion is an adult discussion that primarily focuses on children and young; the proponents often have professional stakes in the subject under discussion as teachers, librarians, cultural critics or academic scholars; the discussion, like a classic narrative, has three phases: a beginning often catapulted by a single case, a peak involving some kind of public or professional intervention, and an end (or fading-out phase) denoting a seeming resolution to the perceived problems in question.

Media panic may be considered a form of moral panic applied to new media.

Ranitomeya,"Ranitomeya is a genus of dart poison frogs found in Panama and South America south to Peru and Brazil, possibly into Bolivia.

Taxonomy
In 2006 Grant et al. revised the systematics of poison dart frogs and placed many species formerly classified in the genera Dendrobates, Minyobates and Phyllobates in Ranitomeya. In 2011 Brown and colleagues, following other scientists who assumed the existence of two distinct clades in Ranitomeya, erected the genus Andinobates for 12 species of Ranitomeya.

Ranitomeya and Andinobates frogs can be distinguished from those in genera such as Dendrobates in that they are generally smaller, have more than two colors, and seem to glitter if viewed from certain angles. Ranitomeya is widespread in the Amazon basin, whereas Andinobates species are found only in the northern Andes down to Central America.

Description
Adults measure no more than  in snout–vent length and are typically brightly colored, often with bright yellow, red, or green dorsum that can be uniform in color or with stripes or dots. Also the throat has distinctive color, usually yellow, orange or red. Dorsal skin is smooth or weakly granular. The head is narrower than the body. Fingers and toes bear discs, with those on the fingers being large.

Threats
Many Ranitomeya species are threatened by habitat loss and collection for the pet trade.

Species 
There are 16 Ranitomeya species:

Dendrobates rubrocephalus Schulte, 1999 is placed here Incertae Sedis.

Literature Translation Institute of Korea,"Literature Translation Institute of Korea (, LTI Korea, formerly known as Korean Literature Translation Fund) was founded in 1996 by the Government of South Korea with the aim of promoting Korean literature and culture overseas in order to contribute to the global culture.

LTI Korea sponsors translation and publication to promote high-quality translation of Korean literature, and is pushing forward with various overseas exchange programs to strengthen the export base for Korean literature and establish a network for Korean and overseas publishers. It also works to foster professional translators to enhance the capacity of translation of Korean literature.

Programs
LTI Korea supports various programs designed to promote awareness of Korean literature and culture abroad. Each program focuses on a specific goal dedicated to building an understanding of Korean literature and culture overseas.

 Translation grants program

 Every quarter, LTI Korea selects and supports translations of various Korean works of literary fiction, poetry, plays, non-fiction, children’s and YA books, genre fiction, and graphic novels. Each application is judged for the quality of the translation and the original work.
 From 2014, LTI Korea does not support the complete translation of the original work. LTI Korea initially provides a grant for the translation of a sample, and the grant for the remainder of the work will be provided after the translator and the author sign a publication contract with an international publisher.

 Publication grants program

 Publication grants are offered to foreign publishers who have acquired copyrights to works that were translated with the support from LTI Korea. 
 Since 2014, LTI Korea provides both translation and publication grants for foreign publishers who have acquired the rights to publish translated Korean literary works.

Support for international cooperation
In an effort to build a strong network between the translators, writers, and people engaged in the publishing business both inside and outside of Korea, LTI Korea holds and participates in various cultural events. The LTI Korea Forum was held in the US, France, Spain, China, Germany and Japan in 2011 with the most recent forum being held in Berlin, Germany in June 2012. Another significant event hosted by LTI Korea is Seoul International Writers’ Festival which is held once every other year. In the festival held in 2010, 24 prominent writers from all over the world got together and had reading and talking sessions under the theme ""Fantasy and Empathy"". Among the writers that participated were Korean writers Bae Suah, Park Hyoung-su, Jeong Chan, Pyun Hye-young, Kim Min-jeong, Kim Haeng-sook, Choi Seoung-ho, Ra Hee-duk, Kim Nam-joong, and Kim Hye-jin. Korean-American writer Min Jin Lee, who won the New York Times Editor’s Choice award for her debut novel “Free Food for Millionaires,” and Pulitzer Prize winner Junot Diaz were also among the list of participants.

Education program

LTI Korea holds translation academies in English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. Designed to be a translator-training program, it currently teaches nearly 100 students, with the aim of expanding the number to 200. Aside from nurturing prospective translators, LTI Korea encourages new and existing translators by awarding them with Korean Literature Translation Awards. 
Another form of effort to promote the exchange of information is LTI Korea’s International Workshop on Translation and Publication of Korean Literature. The 11th International Workshop for Translation and Publication of Korean Literature discussed the globalization of Korean literature in times where Korean culture is receiving more attention than it ever did in the past, due to the popularity of K-pop singers.

Information service

Through the establishment and implementation of the LTI Korea medium and long-term strategy, its information services provide comprehensive information regarding Korean literature and publications and overseas publishing markets. By creating content relevant to the aforementioned in keeping with the new media environment, the information service ensures that LTI Korea's information services are integrated and up-to-date.

LTI Korea library

Opened to the public in 2007, the LTI Korea Library is the first library in Korea which contains collections of Korean books translated into various languages and published overseas. In addition to the translated editions of Korean books, it also collects periodicals on Korean literature, books on translation as well as CD's, DVDs and video tapes on Korean literature.

Periodicals
Korean Literature Now (formerly _list: Books from Korea), also known as KLN is an English literary magazine showcasing Korean literature and writers through interviews, excerpts, features, translators’ notes, and reviews of Korean literature published overseas. KLN has a circulation of about 5,000 including foreign publishers, agencies, Korean Studies programs, university libraries, cultural centers, and exclusive hotels in the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon area.

Mass arrest,"A mass arrest occurs when police apprehend large numbers of suspects at once. This sometimes occurs at protests. Some mass arrests are also used in an effort to combat gang activity. This is sometimes controversial, and lawsuits sometimes result. In police science, it is deemed to be good practice to plan for the identification of those arrested during mass arrests, since it is unlikely that the officers will remember everyone they arrested.

Historical examples
The Japan Farmers' Union and Japanese labor-farmer groups were hit by mass arrests in the 1920s. On April 16, 1929, several thousand members of the farmers' movement were arrested. Following World War II, mass arrests (over 120,000) of actual and suspected Quislings occurred in Norway. Totalitarian regimes have sometimes conducted mass arrests as a prelude to a purge of perceived political enemies, sometimes through executions.

On March 10, 2010 a mass crackdown was initiated to thwart a planned peaceful 'million march' to be conducted in a South Indian state capital of Hyderabad demanding formation of a new federal unit, more than 100,000 Telangana people were taken in to custody by a police force controlled by the coastal 'andhra' elites.

The 2010 G-20 Toronto summit was witness to the largest mass arrest in Canadian history.

Mass arrests of protesters in the United States
In December 1964, the University of California, Berkeley was disrupted by a mass student sit-in in the administration building and by mass arrests of 700 students.

Beginning on May 3, 1971, three days into the 1971 May Day Protests - a series of large-scale civil disobedience actions in Washington, D.C. - massive arrest sweeps begin. In a few days over 12,000 are arrested - the largest mass arrest in U.S. history.

Former American President Jimmy Carter said in regards to the racial conflicts of the time, ""I would be opposed to mass arrest, and I would be opposed to preventive detention.  But I think that the abuses in the past have in many cases exacerbated the disharmonies that brought about demonstrations, and I think that arrest or large numbers of people without warrants ... is a contrary to our best systems of justice.""

A famous mass arrest occurred on September 27, 2002, in Washington, DC in which several hundred anti-World Bank/International Monetary Fund protestors, journalists and bystanders were systematically arrested by police and charged with failure to obey a police order. A class action lawsuit against the government ensued. Pre-emptive mass arrests have also sometimes been criticized.

Over 1,700 protesters were arrested during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City.

On October 1, 2011, more than 700 protesters with the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested while attempting to march across the bridge on the roadway.

On January 28, 2012, more than 400 people were arrested at Oakland.

During a seven-day span on Capitol Hill, from April 11 through April 18, 2016 police arrested approximately 1,240 people (300 arrests were made on April 18 alone) who were demonstrating for reforms to how Americans vote and campaign in elections.

On November 4, 2020, 646 protesters were arrested on Highway 94 in Minneapolis.

War crime 
Indiscriminate mass arrests were designated a war crime in 1944 by a commission on war crimes created by the London International Assembly. Thar was one of two items added by that Commission to the list of war crimes that had been drawn up by the Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties in 1919.  Specifically, ""indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorizing the population"" were designated as war crimes by the commission.

At the Netherlands temporary court martial in 1947, several members of the tokkeitai in the Netherlands East Indies were accused of the war crime of indiscriminate mass arrests. The applicable legislation, used by the court, was the NEI Statute Book Decree #44 of 1946, whose definition of war crimes paralleled the commission's list.  Specifically, item #34 of the enumerated list of war crimes under the NEI legislation was ""indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorising the population, whether described as taking hostages or not"". The court understood the definition of such unlawful mass arrests to be as ""arrests of groups of persons firstly on the ground of wild rumours and suppositions, and secondly without definite facts and indications being present with regard to each person which would justify his arrest"". It added commentary on indiscriminate mass arrests that are for the purpose of terrorizing the populace by stating that they ""contained the elements of systematic terrorism for nobody, even the most innocent, was any longer certain of his liberty, and a person once arrested, even if absolutely innocent, could no longer be sure of health and life"".

Cornelis Boel,"Cornelis Boel (c. 1576 – c. 1621) was a Flemish draughtsman and engraver. He is sometimes known as Cornelis Bol, or Cornelis Bol I, to distinguish him from later artists of the same name.

Life

Boel was born at Antwerp in around  1576. He worked mostly as an engraver, in the style of the Sadeler family, of which he was probably a pupil.

His plates are executed in a clear, neat style. He engraved a set of oval plates for the Fables of Otto Voenius, published at Antwerp in 1608. His most substantial works are eight large plates of the battles of Charles V and Francis I, executed in collaboration with Jode de Gheyn, the younger, after Antonio Tempesta. He engraved also the plates to Salomon de Caus's La perspective avec la raison des ombres et miroirs (1611)

He probably spent some time  in England, as appears from his frontispiece to the first edition of the translation of the Bible published by royal authority in 1611, later known as the ""King James Version"", or the ""Authorized Version"".  It is signed ""C Boel fecit, in Richmont."", which has been taken as an indication that he engraved it while staying at Richmond Palace.  He also engraved  a portrait of Henry, Prince of Wales, an oval print with an ornamental border. published by Pieter de Jode I in around 1611–12; Another plate, of The Last Judgment, is signed ""Cornelis Boel fecit"", with no indication of the name of the painter.

PRIMA1,"Proline-rich membrane anchor 1, also known as PRiMA, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PRIMA1 gene.

Function 

PRiMA functions to organize acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into tetramers, and to anchor AChE at neural cell membranes. This is accomplished by the proline rich anchor domain (PRAD) of PRIMA1 which anchors the tetramer of AChE into the plasma membrane of neural cells and myocytes. The PRAD interacts with the C-terminal T-peptide of AChE.

PRiMA plays a role in targeting AChE to the cell surface and, in neuroblastoma cells, PRiMA the limiting factor of such targeting. In both mice and humans, PRiMA exists as two alternative splice variants that differ in their cytoplasmic regions.

Clinical significance 

The severity of neurogenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, can be related to the degradation of AChE.

Mraclin,"Mraclin is a village in Croatia approximately 20 kilometers south of Zagreb, near the city of Velika Gorica.

The name of Mraclin was documented as early as 1249 and 1255, as Mrachlin. The toponym is likely derived from the names of either Martinus or Marcellus, who could have been landowners in the area, or saints with a local church dedicated to them. Mraclin's church of St. Vitus was established between 1642 and 1688.

Don Cohan,"Donald Smith Cohan (February 24, 1930 in New York City  – 20 October 2018) is one of the leading yachtsmen in the U.S.  He was the first Jew to compete at the highest levels of world yachting competitions and at the time of his active career, the only Jew to win an Olympic medal in yachting.

He won a bronze medal at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Years later, he twice defeated Hodgkin's disease.  He came back to win a U.S. sailing championship at the age of 72.

Biography
Cohan graduated from Amherst College (cum laude; 1951).  There, he was a member of Beta Theta Pi.

He then attended Harvard Law School. He practiced as an attorney, before going into business in real estate.  He became President of Donesco Company, a real estate development firm.

Sailing

Cohan began sailing in 1967 at age 37.  He was on the U.S. team at the World Championships in 1969, 1970, and 1971. Cohan then won the 1972 Olympic trials, becoming the first Jew to be a member of the U.S. Olympic Team in sailing.

In the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, he was set to compete when the Munich Massacre resulted in the killing by terrorists of 11 Israeli athletes.  All Jewish athletes were warned to leave, and two Israelis slated to compete in sailing were instructed to return home immediately. They handed Cohan their satin, blue and white triangular flag, emblazoned with ""Sports Federation of Israel. XXth Olympiad Munich 1972,"" and said:  ""You're representing us now. Go win a medal for us.""

Competing at the age of 42, he came from far back on the final day and earned a bronze medal as helmsman in the mixed three-person  Dragon class, named Caprice.  He earned the medal within just five years from when he began sailing, and was the first Jew to win an Olympic medal in sailing.

Cohan wrote:  ""The last act of [expletives deleted] [U.S. Olympic Committee head and International Olympic Committee president] Avery Brundage was to hang an Olympic medal around my neck.""  Brundage had been a Nazi sympathizer.  He was notorious, among other things, for having pressured to have the only two Jews on the U.S. track team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, sprinters Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller, removed at the very last moment on the morning of their 400-meter relay race, so as not to embarrass Hitler and the Nazis with a Jewish victory. Brundage later publicly praised the Nazi regime at a Madison Square rally.

Cohan has also been U.S. champion, European champion, German champion, and Australian champion.

In 1984, he put his legal skills to good use.  He charged Robbie Haines, one of the competitors in the Olympic yachting Soling trials, with having left too early (or ""barged"") at the start of the race, in Long Beach, California.  Ed Baird, a fellow competitor, said that Cohan ""destroyed Haines in the protest room"", but that ""We're all still pretty close"".  Haines was disqualified for the race.  In the end, however, Haines qualified for the 1984 Olympics, where he won a gold medal.

Hodgkin's disease
Nineteen years after winning his Olympic medal, in 1991, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease of the lymph glands and nodes, and was found to have the most severe type (4B).  He was not expected to survive.

He said to himself, ""Don, you may be very good in your line of business, but you know nothing about this one"", and assembled a team around himself that he could rely on in his fight against the cancer.  Cohan looked for excellent doctors who would allow him to undergo therapy usually considered too grueling for someone his age.  He interviewed doctors, engaged a psychiatrist to help him deal with grief and fear, and told his wife she would be his deputy in the struggle.  He went through aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy, suffered through fatigue, nausea, night sweats, swelling, and pain, and made it through the cancer successfully.

Then, though only one percent of patients get Hodgkin's disease a second time—he found himself in that category.  Again, he was not expected to survive.  Again, he underwent aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  And again, he defeated the cancer.

Sailing, post-Hodgkins

In 2002, at the age of 72, he won the U.S. Soling Championship.  He also finished 5th in the world championship.

Taking a step back to ruminate on sailing competitively at his age, Cohan remarked: ""I'm aware that I'm on the downwind side of the hill, and the reawakened goal of being a competitive sailor has caused me to stir up banked fires and rejuvenate neglected physical abilities.""

He was inducted into the Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

Speed limits in New Zealand,"General speed limits in New Zealand are set by the New Zealand government. The speed limit in each location is indicated on a nearby traffic sign or by the presence of street lighting.  The limits have been posted in kilometres per hour (km/h) since 1974. Before then, when New Zealand used imperial units, maximum speeds were displayed in miles per hour (mph). Today, limits range from  to ; in urban areas the default speed limit is .

History
A 30 mile (48 kilometre) per hour speed limit was imposed in 1930. The limit was raised as vehicles became more powerful. Emergency legislation during the Second World War had amended the general speed limit set by the 1936 Traffic Regulations to 40 mph in order to reduce tyre wear and improve road safety. In 1948, the general speed limit was increased to 50 mph. The default speed limit got raised to  in 1962. In 1969, some open road speed limits were increased to .

On 4 December 1973, the default open road speed limit got dropped to ; this was partly a fuel saving measure in response to the 1973 oil crisis. When New Zealand metricated in 1975, the 50 mph speed limit became 80 km/h while the urban 30 mph speed limit became 50 km/h. Metric speed limits included the legend ""km/h"" to distinguish them from imperial speed limits; this was dropped from 1987 onwards. On 1 July 1985, the open road speed limit was raised to  and this remains the default speed limit today.

Enforcement of New Zealand road speed limits was traditionally done using police speed cameras set up and operated by the police. In 1993, mobile speed cameras were introduced.

Significant changes were made to the rules for setting speed limits in 2003 and 2011, including provision for 40 km/h limits. However, it was then necessary to introduce the Land Transport (Speed Limits Validation) Bill in 2015 to confirm the legitimacy of the previous changes. Another significant change in August 2017 introduced a provision for 110 km/h limits on some motorways and expressways.

Current speed limits
By default, the speed limit is 50 km/h in urban and built-up areas, and 100 km/h outside urban and built-up areas and on expressways and motorways.

Other speed limits include:
110 km/h – found on selected high-quality motorways and expressways.
90 km/h – used sparingly as a compromise between an 80 km/h and a 100 km/h limit.
80 km/h – generally found on rural access roads, winding rural roads, and limited-access urban arterial roads. Between metrication in 1975 and 1985, 80 km/h was the open road limit.
70 km/h – used sparingly as a compromise between a 60 km/h and an 80 km/h limit. Historically it has been used in small country towns, urban fringes (often preceding a change from the open limit to urban limit), or where development is on only one side of the road.
60 km/h – generally found on urban arterial roads, including those through rural townships.
40 km/h – generally found in residential areas. The Land Transport Rule: Setting of Speed Limits 2003 allowed councils to set limits below 50 km/h in urban areas. Since then many councils have set lower limits. For example, Safer Speed Areas were first introduced in Hamilton in 2011 and by 2014 there were 36 of them.–
30 km/h – generally found in some city centres with high pedestrian traffic. 
20 km/h – when approaching and passing a school bus that has stopped on either side of the road to pick up or set down passengers. This speed limit applies to traffic travelling in both directions. Also applies when passing an accident scene.
10 km/h – Often found in designated locations such as car-parks and other places where many vehicles and pedestrians share the road (Shared Zones).

110 km/h limits
The default maximum speed limit on the open road in New Zealand is . The Land Transport (Setting of Speed Limits) Rule 2017, which came into force on 24 August 2017, added a provision to set speed limits of  on selected motorways and expressways. To be considered for a 110 km/h limit, the road must be a dual carriageway, with two lanes in each direction, a median barrier, no at-grade intersections, and no corners rated for a speed below 110 km/h. Vehicles subject to a lower maximum speed, such as heavy trucks and towing vehicles, are still subject to that lower limit.

The first two roads with a 110 km/h speed limit were gazetted on 28 November 2017, with the speed limits coming into force on 11 December 2017. These roads are:

 SH 1 Waikato Expressway, from around 1.3 km south of the Tamahere interchange (SH 21) to the end of the expressway at the Cambridge South interchange.
 SH 2 Tauranga Eastern Link, from the Domain Road interchange to the end of the motorway at the Paengaroa roundabout (SH 33)

Types of speed limit
There are several different types of speed limit:
Default - The default speed limit is only posted as the speed limit when entering or leaving the designated urban and rural areas. In urban areas the default speed limit is 50 km/h, while in rural areas the speed limit is 100 km/h. The definition of an urban area is based on the presence of street lighting.
Permanent - where the posted speed limit is set for the specific section of road. There are repeater signs every 2 to 3 kilometers on these roads. These limits are often posted in areas where the urban or rural nature of the area is not obvious to road users and applying the default speed limit is unsafe.
Holiday - where the posted speed limit only applies for specific (holiday) periods. Outside the specific period the speed limit sign is removed or not visible. An example is on  through Pelorus Bridge, which has a holiday speed limit of 50 km/h annually between 20 December and 31 January, but outside these dates the default limit of 100 km/h applies.
Variable - where the speed limit can change at different times of the day due to the changing nature of road hazards. Often found in the school zone around many educational institutions. May also be encountered on roads that have peak hour congestion or weather related hazards. Traffic travelling in different directions may potentially encounter different limits.
Temporary - are put in place when there is work taking place on or near the road that makes the existing speed limit unsafe.
Emergency - can be imposed during and after natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, tornadoes, etc. where existing speed limits are unsafe.

Advisory speeds
Advisory speeds are often given for road bends, corners, humps, dips and other short sections of road where driving at the speed limit may be uncomfortable or unsafe. These advisory speeds are indicated by a yellow sign with black lettering. They advise of a comfortable speed through a corner in dry weather for a light motor vehicle. Heavy vehicle drivers are advised to keep 10 km/h below the advisory speed to avoid exceeding the static rollover threshold.

Minimum speed 

Although there is no minimum posted speed limit, it is illegal to drive at an ""unreasonably slow speed"" which means slow drivers are required by law to pull over to the side of the road to allow queues of cars behind them to pass. The police can and do enforce this law in which the offending driver is given anything from an NZ$150 infringement notice for ""Inconsiderate Driving"" to possibly an indictment for careless driving which is usually dealt with by the courts.

Operating speed limits 
Certain types and combinations of vehicles have operating speed limits that need to be obeyed if they are less than the posted speed limit. For example: Vehicles towing trailers or another vehicle with a rigid towing connection are limited to 90 km/h. If the towing connection is not rigid, such as a rope or strop, then the operating limit is 50 km/h, apart from disabled motorcycles.

Signage
New Zealand speed limit signs follow the European model of a number inside a red circle. Sometimes, the open road limit occurs as a black forward slash inside a thin black ring (similar to the UK's National Speed Limit sign).

Algeciras campaign,"The Algeciras campaign (sometimes known as the Battle or Battles of Algeciras) was an attempt by a French naval squadron from Toulon under Contre-Admiral Charles Linois to join a French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz during June and July 1801 during the French Revolutionary War prior to a planned operation against either Egypt or Portugal. To reach Cadiz, the French squadron had to pass the British naval base at Gibraltar, which housed the squadron tasked with blockading Cadiz. The British squadron was commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez. After a successful voyage between Toulon and Gibraltar, in which a number of British vessels were captured, the squadron anchored at Algeciras, a fortified port city within sight of Gibraltar across Gibraltar Bay. On 6 July 1801, Saumarez attacked the anchored squadron, in the First Battle of Algeciras. Although severe damage was inflicted on all three French ships of the line, none could be successfully captured and the British were forced to withdraw without HMS Hannibal, which had grounded and was subsequently seized by the French.

In the aftermath of the first battle, both sides set about making urgent repairs and calling up reinforcements. On 9 July a fleet of five Spanish and one French ship of the line and several frigates arrived from Cadiz to safely escort Linois's squadron to Cadiz, and the British at Gibraltar redoubled their efforts to restore their squadron to fighting service. In the evening of 12 July the French and Spanish fleet sailed from Algeciras, and the British force followed them, catching the trailing ships in the Second Battle of Algeciras and opening fire at 11:20. A confused night action followed, in which the British ship HMS Superb cut through the disorganised allied rearguard, followed by the rest of Saumarez's force. In the confusion one French ship was captured, a Spanish frigate sank and two huge 112-gun Spanish first rates collided and exploded, killing as many as 1,700 men. The following morning the French ship Formidable came under attack at the rear of the combined squadron, but successfully drove off pursuit and reached Cadiz safely.

Ultimately the French and Spanish fleets were successful in their aim of uniting at Cadiz, albeit after heavy losses, but they were still under blockade and in no position to realise either the Egyptian or Portuguese plans. The two battles, ""generally regarded as a single linked battle"", proved decisive in cementing British control of the Mediterranean Sea and condemning the French army in Egypt to defeat, totally unsupported by reinforcements from the French Navy.

Background
On 1 August 1798, a British fleet surprised and almost completely destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile in the aftermath of the successful French invasion of Egypt. This immediately reversed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean Sea, eliminating the French fleet based at Toulon as a significant threat and granting the British and their allies in the War of the Second Coalition naval dominance in the region. Over the next three years, British and allied squadrons enforced blockades against all significant French and Spanish naval bases in the region, including Alexandria, Corfu and Malta but particularly the significant harbours at Toulon and Cadiz. This drastically limited the movement of French troops and military materials across the Mediterranean, with the result that Malta and Corfu were captured and the army in Egypt was steadily reduced in size and effectiveness.

In January 1801, in an attempt to increase the size of the French Mediterranean Fleet and to reinforce the beleaguered Egyptian garrison, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered a squadron of seven ships of the line to sail from Brest on the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. The squadron made three unsuccessful attempts to reach Egypt, eventually retiring to Toulon in late July 1801. During the final effort, Ganteaume's squadron sailed from Toulon on 27 April 1801 with instructions to briefly secure local naval supremacy around Elba to allow a seabourne invasion to go ahead, before travelling on into the Eastern Mediterranean. During these operations, Ganteaume discovered that several ships in his force were dangerously undermanned, and therefore decided to consolidate his crews and send three ships of the line, Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole back to Toulon.

The presence of this force at Toulon enabled the French to plan a secondary operation using Ganteaume's new arrivals. A deal had been brokered earlier in the year between Bonaparte and Charles IV of Spain for the Spanish government to provide six ships of the line from the Cadiz fleet to the French Navy. Orders were given that the new squadron at Cadiz was to be joined by the three ships of the line detached from Ganteaume's squadron, as well as the frigate Muiron under the overall command of Rear-Admiral Charles Linois. This force of nine French ships, accompanied by six promised vessels from the Spanish fleet, was then to fulfil one of two mooted plans: the first was a large scale attack on Lisbon. Portugal and Spain were engaged in the War of the Oranges and Lisbon was a major British trading port: the French admiral Kerguelen had estimated some years earlier that an attack there could seize as much as ""2 millions"" of British goods and shipping. The other planned operation, adopted following the end of the War of the Oranges on 2 June, was for the force to resupply Egypt using soldiers stationed at Italian ports. To facilitate the transfer of the Spanish ships to French control, Napoleon ordered Contre-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley to sail to Cadiz. Le Pelley arrived at the Spanish port on 13 June in the frigates Libre and Indienne with sailors to begin manning the newly purchased ships and Commodore Julien le Ray to command them. His arrival was noted by the British blockade squadron off Cadiz under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, a veteran of the Battle of the Nile and one of Lord Nelson's famous ""Band of Brothers"": Le Pelley's ships were chased by HMS Superb and HMS Venerable, but the French admiral managed to evade his pursuers and reach Cadiz safely. Saumarez had been ordered to Cadiz in May 1801 with orders not only to blockade the Spanish fleet, but also specifically to watch for an attempt by a French squadron to link with the Spanish fleet at Cadiz.

Linois's voyage

Linois sailed from Toulon on 13 June 1801 with three ships of the line and one frigate carrying 1,560 soldiers under Brigadier-General Devaux. Ganteaume's earlier expedition was still in the Eastern Mediterranean, and so the British blockade force under Sir John Borlase Warren detailed to watch Toulon was instead off Malta hoping to intercept Ganteaume on his return. Therefore, the only British ships on hand when Linois emerged from the port were a few frigates, which were easily chased away by the larger warships of the French squadron. Linois's passage was slow, facing winds from the southwest that delayed his squadron so that by 30 June they were only off Cape de Gata in the Alboran Sea. On 1 July they were spotted from Gibraltar, although the only warship there was the 14-gun HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas which was unable to influence their advance. Instead, Captain Dundas ordered Lieutenant Richard Janvarin to take a boat and communicate with the Cadiz blockade force of seven ships of the line, under Saumarez.

Linois passed Gibraltar on 3 July and during the night discovered the 14-gun brig HMS Speedy a short distance ahead. Linois's squadron had captured a number of merchant vessels during their voyage but this was their first warship, and although it was no match for size, Speedy was an infamous vessel under the command of Captain Lord Cochrane. Cochrane had spent the last year raiding the Spanish coast with great success, taking or destroying more than 50 ships including the celebrated Action of 6 May 1801 in which Cochrane had attacked and captured the far larger Spanish privateer frigate Gamo off Barcelona. Cochrane's initial belief that the strange ships were Spanish treasure vessels caused him to bring Speedy closer to the ships and by the time he realised his error escape was impossible. Rather than surrender however, Cochrane threw all of his guns and excessive weight overboard and manoeuvered his ship to avoid coming into range of the French broadsides. He then attempted to cut directly between the approaching Formidable and Desaix, the small target avoiding the concentrated fire of the French ships and pulling into open water. At this, Commodore Jean-Anne Christy-Pallière on Desaix swung his ship about and pursued, several shots damaging Speedy's sails and rigging. As Speedy slowed, Desaix overtook the small brig and fired a full broadside at close range. This was fired as the French ship was on the uproll and therefore missed the deck entirely and failed to cause a single casualty. It did however tear away the remaining rigging and sails, leaving Speedy unmanageable. Rather than suffer another broadside, Cochrane surrendered his ship and was taken aboard Desaix, where Christy-Pallière acknowledged his brave defence by refusing to accept Cochrane's surrendered sword with the words ""I will not accept the sword of an officer who has for so many hours struggled against impossibility"". From Cochrane, Linois learned of Saumarez's presence ahead of him and, knowing that his presence would have been reported by the garrison at Gibraltar, his squadron returned eastwards around Cabrita Point and came to anchor at Algeciras, a fortified Spanish port which lay directly opposite and within sight of Gibraltar across the Bay of Gibraltar on 4 July.

Off Cadiz, the squadron under Saumarez was notified of Linois's arrival by Lieutenant Janvarin at 02:00 on 5 July and immediately turned back towards Gibraltar, tacking against the wind. The frigate HMS Thames was detached and sent  westwards to the mouth of the Guadalquivir River to collect HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which was blockading the river with the small brig HMS Pasley. Keats did follow Saumarez back to Algeciras, and was in distantly in sight when the battle commenced, but on hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had escaped the bay and was at sea once more, Keats reasoned that the French must be returning to Toulon and that he would be in a better position returning to the blockade of Cadiz than attempting to join Saumarez's chase. The lugger HMS Plymouth was also detached to Lisbon with despatches for the Admiralty informing them of Saumarez's intentions. The British admiral, knowing that Linois was still anchored in the bay, intended to descend on Algeciras immediately but was beset by a series of calm spells that prevented his squadron from doing more than slowly drifting eastwards away from Superb and towards Algeciras. It was not until the morning of 6 July therefore that Saumarez was in a position to attack the anchored French squadron. In anticipation of Saumarez's arrival, Linois had formed his squadron into a strong defensive position, the three ships of the line anchored in a line north to south across in shallow waters off the mouth of Algeciras harbour, protected by Spanish forts at either extremity and around the town itself, where Murion was anchored in shallower water. Linois led the line himself in Formidable, but despatched parties from the crews of the ships of the line to augment the Spanish defences.

First Battle of Algeciras

At 07:00, Saumarez ordered his squadron to advance into the bay without delay and engage the French directly, the attack to be led by Captain Samuel Hood in HMS Venerable. Hood was delayed by light winds however, and the first ship into action was HMS Pompée under Captain Charles Stirling, which attacked the anchored French ships in succession before anchoring close to Formidable. Pompée was followed by HMS Audacious, Saumarez's flagship HMS Caesar and HMS Hannibal, with Venerable and  HMS Spencer participating at a greater distance due to the unreliable wind. By 10:00 both squadrons were fully engaged except for Pompée at the head of the British line which had been caught by a current and swung so that the ship's bow was facing Formidable's broadside, allowing Linois to rake the British ship. Seeing the danger Stirling was in, Saumarez ordered Captain Solomon Ferris to take Hannibal around the head of the French line and rake Formidable. In the light wind, Ferris took almost an hour to reach the head of the lines, but as he turned inshore, Hannibal grounded on a shoal directly under the guns of the Spanish fort at Torre de Almirante.

Saumarez ordered his squadron's boats to assist Hannibal and Pompée, both of which were trapped under heavy fire and unable to effectively respond. As he did so, Linois ordered his ships to cut their anchor cables and drift into the shallows, away from the becalmed British squadron. Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both Desaix and Indomptable grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents. At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing Pompée back to Gibraltar, there was no possibility of launching an amphibious operation against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded Hannibal in the Bay of Gibraltar.

Hannibal had been exposed to the combined French and Spanish fire for four hours, and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded. In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship. French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign upside down to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a signal of distress, and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.

The French victory had come at a heavy cost: more than 160 men were killed and 300 wounded and all three French ships had been severely damaged. Among the dead were the captains of both Formidable and Indomptable, although Linois was unhurt. The Spanish had suffered eleven men killed and five gunboats had been destroyed. The batteries and town had also been badly damaged in the fighting. British losses were also heavy, with more than 130 killed and more than 230 wounded, most of which had been lost on Hannibal and Pompée. In addition to the loss of Hannibal, Pompée was severely damaged and the remainder of the British squadron all required urgent repairs.

Interlude
Immediately following the battle, Linois used overland messengers to request the assistance of the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral Jose de Mazzaredo. Linois and Saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as Trafalgar Cemetery. Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, Pompée and Caesar, be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in the Bay of Gibraltar when they were sent to aid Hannibal in the last stages of the battle. The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain Alexander Ball, naval commissioner at Gibraltar. Captain Jahleel Brenton of Caesar protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: Caesar's crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout the night for the next week to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, Caesar sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days. Saumarez also sent a boat under a flag of truce in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under parole of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on Hannibal. Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on HMS Plymouth with despatches, to await the court-martial for the loss of his ship. He and his officers were completely exonerated.

Linois also began a programme of refloating and making extensive repairs to his ships, including the captured Hannibal, which he renamed Annibal. Jury masts were set up on the battered hulk, although such extensive repairs were required that when Linois sailed a week later the ship was still only just seaworthy, and was sent back to Algeciras. In Cadiz, despite Spanish hesitation, the messages from Linois coupled with strong representations from le Pelley prompted Mazzaredo to order a squadron to sea on the morning of 9 July, commanded by Vice-Admiral Don  and including two very large first rate ships of the line: Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo, each mustering 112 guns. The remainder of the squadron consisted of a 96-gun Spanish ship, an 80-gun Spanish ship, a 74-gun Spanish ship as well as the 74-gun ship Saint Antoine, which a few days earlier had been the Spanish San Antonio. The first of the purchased ships of the line to be commissioned into the French Navy, Saint Antoine's crew was drawn from the men brought to Cadiz on the frigates Libre and Indienne, supplemented by a number of Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Le Ray. Accompanying the squadron were the frigates Libre, the Spanish Sabina and the French lugger Vautour.

The departure of this combined squadron was observed by Captain Richard Goodwin Keats on HMS Superb, which after returning to Cadiz had retained station off the port with HMS Thames and HMS Pasley. Thames was inshore searching a seized American merchant ship, and witnessed the emergence of the squadron retreating before four ships of the line that approached the British frigate. Superb was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of the line and two frigates, as they repaired to the outer roads ready to sail with the land breeze the following morning. As the fleet prepared to sail in the morning Keats immediately sent Pasley ahead to Gibraltar to warn Saumarez, the brig arriving at 15:00 closely followed by the British men of war sailing under a crowd of canvas and signalling the approach of the enemy as they arrived up. No sooner had they rounded Cabrita Point than the Spanish reinforcements were seen entering the bay (save for the San Antoine, which had been unable to work out of the harbour and arrived the following day). Moreno's squadron anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, out of reach of the British batteries on Gibraltar and waited there for Linois to complete his repairs, Saint Antoine joining the squadron on the morning of 10 July. Keats brought his ships into Gibraltar, where efforts to repair the squadron were increased, with the knowledge that Moreno would soon be sailing to Cadiz with Linois squadron. Saumarez, concerned by the size of the combined squadron, sent urgent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith in the Eastern Mediterranean requesting support in the belief that Moreno would be delayed at least two weeks due to the condition of Linois's ships. Saumarez was wrong: Moreno planned to convoy the battered squadron the short distance to Cadiz as soon as they were seaworthy.

Second battle of Algeciras

On the morning of 12 July the combined French and Spanish squadron put to sea, followed closely by the British squadron. Both sides took most of the day to assemble, hampered by light winds and damaged warships, but at 19:00 Moreno gave orders for his squadron to make all sail westwards towards the open ocean and Cadiz. Saumarez followed, but at 20:40, with night drawing in and the wind picking up, he instructed Keats to take Superb, the fastest ship in his squadron, ahead and engage the rearguard of Moreno's force. 

The wind soon freshened to a hard gale in the straits and the Superb went at 11.5 knots, leaving her compatriots some miles behind as she closed on the retreating enemy. At 23:20, with lights concealed and making no signals, she ranged up alongside a Spanish three- decker -the Real Carlos, and discharged three broadsides into her before being met by return of fire. Some of the shot was high and passed through the rigging of the Real Carlos to hit a ship to her larboard – the Spanish three-decker San Hermenegildo. In the confusion she mistook the Real Carlos as her enemy, which resulted in a general cannonade throughout the enemy squadron. In about ten minutes the Real Carlos was observed to be on fire. The San Hermenegildo still believing the Real Carlos to be the enemy closed to send raking fire through her stern, but was caught in a violent gust that brought the two ships together so the fire spread to both ships, which subsequently blew up – the concussion being felt as far away as Cádiz – and were completely destroyed with horrendous loss of life. More than 1700 men perished. At some stage during the night, the independently sailing Spanish frigate Perla sailed through the battle and was fatally damaged in the crossfire, sinking the next morning.

Keats meanwhile had engaged and defeated Saint Antoine, forcing the wounded Commodore Julien le Ray to surrender following an action that had lasted just half an hour. Casualties on Saint Antoine were heavy, although Superb had just 15 men wounded. The rest of the British squadron, following up in the darkness, mistook Saint Antoine as being still active, and all fired on the ship as they passed, intending to catch the remainder of Moreno's squadron as it sailed northwest along the Spanish coastline. At 04:00 the Formidable, now under the command of Captain Amable Troude, was seen to the north in Conil Bay near Cape Trafalgar and Saumarez sent Venerable to chase the French ship, Hood accompanied by Thames under Captain Aiskew Hollis. At 05:15, Venerable came within range and a close action soon followed, Hood ordering Hollis to bring his ship close to Troude's stern and open up a raking fire. Formidable had the better of the action however and at 06:45, with casualties mounting, Hood's mainmast collapsed over the side. Note B

Taking advantage of the disability to the British ship, Troude pulled Formidable ahead in light winds, slowly rejoining the main squadron under Moreno, which was holding station off Cadiz harbour. As Formidable moved away, the remaining masts on Venerable collapsed and the ship grounded off Sancti Petri. There was concern in the British squadron that Moreno might counterattack the disabled ship, but the arrival on the horizon of Audacious and Superb persuaded the Spanish admiral to withdraw into Cadiz. Hood was able to refloat Venerable on 13 July and the ship was towed back to Gibraltar with the prize Saint Antoine. Saumarez left three ships to maintain the blockade at Cadiz, returning the situation off the port to that before the battle.

Aftermath
In France the campaign was represented as a victory, as Linois' genuine achievements at Algeciras were followed by exaggerated reports of Troude's defence in Conil Bay in which the second battle was represented as a significant success against a more numerous British force. Troude had shown skill and bravery in the engagement, but his subsequent reputation was largely built on the strength of a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley which was based on a letter written by Captain Troude. In the letter, he claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames, but also Caesar and Spencer (misidentified in the report as Superb). Troude stated that he had not only driven all of these ships off, but that he had also completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore. Troude was subsequently promoted and highly praised, holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy. In Spain, the outcome of the campaign infuriated the Spanish government and contributed to the souring of the Franco-Spanish alliance. The Spanish demanded that the Spanish forces then stationed at Brest on the French Atlantic coast return to Spanish waters, and Spanish pressure on Portugal was relaxed. This weakening of the Franco-Spanish axis was a significant factor in the Treaty of Amiens in early 1802 that brought the French Revolutionary Wars to a close.

Saumarez was lauded in Britain, the success of the second action mitigating the initial defeat. He was awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and made a Knight of the Bath with a pension of £1,200 annually (the equivalent of £ as of ).. Nearly five decades later, the second battle (although not the first) was among the actions recognised by the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. The campaign later played a prominent part in the novels Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian and Touch and Go by C. Northcote Parkinson. In British histories the campaign is usually considered a single linked battle, with the overall outcome favourable to the British force, despite the failure to prevent Linois from linking with Cadiz and the loss of Hannibal. The severe losses inflicted on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and the reinstatement of the blockade meant that the French plan to reinforce the army trapped in Egypt was a total failure, the garrison there surrendering in September after a hard-fought campaign against British and Ottoman forces. It also emphasised British dominance at sea by this stage of the war, reiterating that no force could sail from a French or allied port without detection and interception by the Royal Navy, but still not dominant enough to conquer the bulk of  Spanish America.

Gadhai,"The Gadhai are a Muslim community found in the state of Gujarat in India.

Origin 
The Gadhai claim to have immigrated from Rajasthan about five hundred years ago. They were first settled in Kutch, where they were employed by the local Rajputs, and then brought to Saurashtra by the Kathi rulers. The Gadhai bred donkeys, which were the main beasts of burdens. They are said to get their name from the Gujarati word for a donkey, which is gadha, and gadhai means a donkey keeper. The Gadhai were also involved in selling salt. According to their traditions, the community were once Rajputs, who lost status as a result of their conversion to Islam. They are now found mainly in the districts of Amreli, Bhavnagar and Junagadh.  The Gadhai speak Gujarati, but some also understand Urdu.

Present circumstances 
The community is divided into thirteen clans, all of whom intermarry. Their main clans are  Savant,Kaliya, Lalliya, Rathore (Rathod), Musia, Gagaina, Ming, Saag, Zorana, Sayara, Mamodia, Lallagh and Naar.

The Gadhai have seen a decline in their traditional occupation, which was selling salt. Many are now small and medium-sized farmers. A smaller number are sharecroppers, with a few employed as agricultural labourers. The Gadhai are Sunni Muslims, and have customs similar to other Gujarati Muslim communities.

Aristippus of Argos,"Aristippus of Argos (; ) was a tyrant of Argos in the 3rd century BC. His grandfather may have been the Aristippus installed as tyrant by the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas in 272, and his father was the tyrant Aristomachos the Elder. When Aristomachus was assassinated by slaves in 240, Aristippus took control of the city.

After resisting several assaults by the Achaean League under Aratus of Sicyon, Aristippus was killed during an unsuccessful counterattack on the city of Cleonae in 235. He was succeeded by his younger brother Aristomachos of Argos who later led his city to join the Achaean League.

An Argive, a different person from the preceding, who also became tyrant of Argos after the murder of Aristomachus I., in the time of Aratus. He is described by Plutarch as a perfect tyrant in our sense of the word. Aratus made many attempts to deprive him of the tyranny, but at first without success; but Aristippus at length fell in a battle against Aratus, and was succeeded in the tyranny by Aristomachus II.

Hermann von Münster,"Hermann von Münster (c. 1330 – March 1392) was a German master glassmaker, native of Münster, in Westphalia, and active in Lorraine.

Biography 
Hermman von Münster  is actually the first stained glass artist to be mentioned by the archives of the Cathedral chapter of Saint-Etienne of Metz. On August 29, 1381, master Hermann received an annuity of 22 pounds, to pay for its work on the western large window of the cathedral of Metz. His work was supported by Cardinal William Aigrefeuille, legate of the antipope Clement VII, who then reorganized the Chapter of Metz. Three years later, on 2 May 1384, the Cathedral chapter negotiated the price of the ""GRANT OZ"", the western Rose window with Hermann von Munster. Hermann was still working on the windows of the western facade in December 1384. In August 1385, the Cathedral Chapter borrowed 420 pounds to set the work completed.

In 1388, Hermann bought a home in Metz, beside the cathedral, where he died in March 1392. Thanks to his fame and to the excellent quality of his work, Hermann was buried in the aisle of the cathedral. An epitaph on the north wall of the cathedral indicates in old French:

CI DEVANT GIST
MAISTRE HARMAN LI VALRIER
DE MUNSTERE AN WAILTEFALLE,
ET FIST LE GRANT OZ DE CEANS,
QUI MORUT LE JOR DE LA NOSTRE DAME
EN MARS M.CCC.IIIIXX et XII.

The only information known about Herman von Münster concerns of the cathedral of Metz, in particular the large western window of the nave of Metz.

Technical overview 
To assemble the window, pieces of colored and painted glass were first laid out on the design board, with the edges of each piece fitted into H-shaped strips of lead. Then, these cames were soldered to one another. When a panel was completed, putty was inserted between the glass and the lead cames for waterproofing. The entire composition was then stabilized with an iron armature and mounted in the window.

Stylistic influences 
It seems that the style of Herman von Münster is to link to the Westphalian context. His work is close in style to the work of the master of Altenberg, near Münster. But the figures of the master of Altenberg are less expressive, and stricter. The characters in the bottom of the western windows of Metz, richly dressed, stand under colourful architectural niches. The use of thicker glass, with more sustained tones than in France, far from being an archaism, testifies of the influence that the medieval Rhenish style had on his work.

Oxford Today,"Oxford Today: The University Magazine was a magazine for the alumni of Oxford University.

Oxford Today was a magazine distributed free to around 160,000 alumni around the world. It appeared three times a year, with the issues coinciding with the three Oxford academic terms of Michaelmas, Hilary, and Trinity. The editor was Dr Richard Lofthouse, and  it was published by Future plc on behalf of the University of Oxford.

Articles covered subjects such as current affairs, history, literature, as well as the University itself. Contributors and interviewees had included many Oxford alumni from different walks of life, such as the politician Michael Heseltine, the author and playwright Alan Bennett and the comedian Terry Jones of Monty Python fame.

The magazine was previously published by Wiley-Blackwell. In April 2010, it was reported that a new publisher would be taking over the magazine, resulting in the job of then-current editor Greg Neale being placed under review; this caused concern among members of the publication's editorial review board, some of whom expressed the view that the Oxford administration was seeking to reduce the magazine's independence. The magazine was published by FuturePlus, a division of Future Publishing Limited, on behalf of the University of Oxford. After a review of the magazine and its mounting costs, Oxford University took the decision to close the publication with its last issue published in Trinity 2017.

Graveldiver,"The graveldiver (Scytalina cerdale) is a species of perciform fish, the only species in the genus Scytalina and the family Scytalinidae. Graveldivers are small, with snake-like heads (hence the generic name). Their bodies are compact, and lack pelvic fins, with very small pectoral fins. Their range encompasses the coastal area from the Bering Sea to central California.

Taxonomy and naming
The generic name Scytalina is of a Greek origin, from the diminutive of skytale, meaning ""viper"". This refers to the snake-like head. The specific name cerdale means ""wary one"" or ""the fox"", in allusion to its agility and quick movement when disturbed. Jordan and Gilbert suggested an alternative generic name Scytaliscus due to the similarity between Scytalina and the unrelated genus Scytalinus. This name is unnecessary and is not in wide use.

Description
Graveldivers are small fish, reaching lengths of only ,  but usually not exceeding . They are long and compressed, resembling blennies. The head is snake-like, and the dorsal fins and anal fins have no soft rays, and are supported only by thin spines. Each has 41–51 spines, originating deep in the skin. They are at opposite sides of the body. The dorsal and anal fins converge at the rounded caudal fin. The pectoral fins are very small, with only about eight rays, and the pelvic fins and girdle are absent altogether. Graveldivers have no lateral lines, scales, pyloric caeca, or swim bladders. They are pinkish-brown in colour, and may bear some purple markings. The edge of the caudal (tail) fin is reddish-orange.

Distribution and habitat

Graveldivers are marine fish found in the cold northern and eastern Pacific Ocean, from the Bering Sea on the Alaskan coast to Diablo Cave in central California. They are demersal fish, occurring in tidal pools and rocky bottoms. They may burrow under rocks and substrates such as sand, gravel, and broken shells, hence their name. They may burrow to depths of  or more. Graveldivers generally inhabit shallow intertidal and subtidal areas.

German camp brothels in World War II,"In World War II, Nazi Germany established brothels in the concentration camps (Lagerbordell) to create an incentive for prisoners to collaborate, although these institutions were used mostly by Kapos, ""prisoner functionaries"" and the criminal element, because regular inmates, penniless and emaciated, were usually too debilitated and wary of exposure to Schutzstaffel (SS) schemes. In the end, the camp brothels did not produce any noticeable increase in the prisoners' work productivity levels, but instead, created a market for coupons among the camp VIPs. 

The women forced into these brothels came mainly from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, except for Auschwitz, which employed its own prisoners. In combination with the German military brothels in World War II, it is estimated that at least 34,140 female inmates were forced into sexual slavery during the Third Reich.

History and operation

The first camp brothel was established in Mauthausen/Gusen in 1942. After 30 June 1943, a camp brothel existed in Auschwitz, and from 15 July 1943, in Buchenwald. The one in Neuengamme was established in early 1944, Dachau's in May 1944, Dora-Mittelbau's in late summer, and Sachsenhausen's on 8 August 1944. There are conflicting dates for the camp brothel in Flossenbürg: one source claims summer 1943; another states it was not opened until 25 March 1944.

The camp brothels were usually built as barracks surrounded by a barbed-wire fence, with small individual rooms for up to 20 female prisoners, controlled by a female overseer (Aufseherin). The women were replaced frequently due to exhaustion and illness, and were usually sent away to their deaths later. The brothels were open only in the evenings. No Jewish male prisoners were allowed as patrons. Those with access to the customer lineup (Aryan VIPs only), had to sign up for a specific day and pay two reichsmarks for a 20-minute ""service"" based on a predetermined schedule. The women were matched with clients by an SS-man. The market for the ""prize-coupons"" was routinely cornered by the common criminals who wore the green triangles (hence the ""green men"" denomination). There is evidence (somewhat controversial) that in some of the brothels, women might have had tattoos inscribed on their chests saying Feld-Hure (""field whore""). Some of them underwent forced sterilizations as well as forced abortions, often resulting in death.

The subject of forced prostitution in the camps was alluded to in survivors' memoirs at least as early as 1972, when the first edition of Heinz Heger's book was published. However, the subject remained largely taboo in studies of Nazism until the mid-1990s, when new publications by female researchers broke the silence.

Sometimes the SS enticed women into serving in the brothels by promising them more humane treatment or reductions of their indefinite sentence. This caused anger or envy among some female inmates. Nina Michailovna, Russian camp prisoner, reported: ""When we found out that a girl in our block was chosen, we caught her and threw a blanket on her and beat her up so badly that she could hardly move. It wasn't clear if she would recover. They just wanted to have a better life and we punished them this way.""

Homosexual prisoners and camp brothels 

In addition to using camp brothels as a means to control inmates, encourage collaboration, and prevent riots and escapes, Heinrich Himmler intended them to be used as a means of teaching pink triangle prisoners ""the joys of the opposite sex"", i.e., as ""therapy"" for their homosexuality. Heger claims that Himmler directed that all gay prisoners were to make compulsory visits to the camp brothel once per week as a means of ""curing"" them of homosexuality.

Cultural references 
The French documentary Night and Fog mentioned the existence of concentration camp brothels as early as 1955.  This film, by director Alain Resnais, included extensive original footage of the camps and was based on interviews with survivors. 
German concentration camp brothels were also re-enacted in fictional Nazi exploitation films made in the 1970s such as Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, Last Orgy of the Third Reich, Love Camp 7, SS Experiment Camp and Nazi Love Camp 27. 
Examples of Israeli literature on the subject include writer's Yehiel De-Nur alias K. Tzetnik's book The House of Dolls and the Stalag fiction genre. 

Czech author Arnošt Lustig wrote a novel Lovely Green Eyes (), which tells a story of a 15-year-old Jewish girl deported to a camp and forced to serve in a brothel during World War II. In the 1950s-set Australian television drama A Place to Call Home, main character Sarah Adams is an Australian who converted to Judaism and was imprisoned at Ravensbrück concentration camp before being forced into a camp brothel.

Amish Grace,"Amish Grace is a television film that premiered on the Lifetime Movie Network on Palm Sunday, March 28, 2010.  The film is based on the 2006 West Nickel Mines School shooting at Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, and the spirit of forgiveness the Amish community demonstrated in its aftermath.

The film stars Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Tammy Blanchard, and Matt Letscher and is based on the book Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy, Jossey-Bass, 2007, , by Donald Kraybill, Steven Nolt, and David L. Weaver-Zercher. Amish Grace was executive-produced by Larry A. Thompson, written by Sylvie White and Teena Booth, and directed by Gregg Champion.

Plot
When a group of Amish schoolgirls are taken hostage and killed in their classroom, their parents and the Amish community of Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, stun the outside world by immediately forgiving the killer.  Ida Graber (Kimberly Williams-Paisley), mother of one of the murdered children, has a tougher time than the others accepting the tragedy, but in her anguish and pain, she begins a personal journey of renewed faith, ultimately accepting the heart-wrenching tragedy of losing a child after learning that her murdered daughter, Mary Beth Graber, had promised to pray for the perpetrator before her death; reconnecting with her husband (Matt Letscher), family, and community; offering forgiveness to the killer; and even showing kindness and compassion to the killer's widow (Tammy Blanchard) and children — all in the form of Amish grace.

The film was dedicated in memory of the victims of the West Nickel Mines School shooting.

Reception
The film mostly received positive reviews; however, it received criticism because the authors of Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy, Jossey-Bass, 2007, , distanced themselves from the production out of respect to the Amish community. Others criticized the film for blending facts with fiction.

He also obtained a master's degree in biochemistry before joining the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) for a PhD degree in microbiology and immunology. In 1996 he was awarded his PhD. He received his postdoctoral training with Patricia Spear at Northwestern University in Chicago.

Family
He is the youngest son of Kala Rani Shukla and Ram Chandra Shukla. He has six siblings: Rekha, Pradeep, Dileep, Prakash, Rachana, and Anand, who all live in India. Deepak Shukla became a naturalized citizen of the US in 2007.

Work and awards
In 2001 Shukla joined UIC as an assistant professor of virology. He is jointly employed by the UIC Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Currently, he serves as the Marion H. Schenk Esq. Professor in Ophthalmology. He is also a professor of virology and the director of the Ocular Virology Laboratory of UIC.

Shukla has been directly associated with the discoveries of HSV-1 entry receptors, 3-O. Besides 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate, he also cloned and characterized the receptors (HVEM, nectin-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate) for experimental HSV-1 infection in mice. His more recent works include identification of a phagocytosis-like pathway for HSV-1 entry into ocular cells, significance of heparan sulfate in ocular infection, significance of autophagy in herpes infection, and development of a nanoparticle based herpes vaccine. He also discovered viral surfing in herpesviruses. His laboratory was first to implicate heparanase in HSV-1 release and syndecans in HSV-1 entry and cell-to-cell fusion. He has also used his knowledge of HSV-1 entry mechanism to identify new pharmaceutical agents to protect and treat HSV-1 infection in laboratory animals. His work has also focused on genital herpes and ways to control the spread of the disease.

His work has been recognized with merit awards and research grants from various organizations, including from the American Herpes Foundation (2001) for herpesvirus research and his discovery of a receptor for HSV-1 entry; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (2002–present); the Illinois Society to Prevent Blindness (2004); The Glaucoma Foundation (2007 and 2010); and the National Eye Institute (2013–present). Shukla received the Lew Wasserman Merit Award from Research to Prevent Blindness in 2009.

"George Buchanan (engineer, born 1790)","George Buchanan FRSE FRSSA (c. 1790, Montrose – 30 October 1852) was a Scottish civil engineer and land surveyor who worked primarily on bridges and harbours. He supervised the construction of the Scotland Street tunnel and the Granton to Edinburgh tunnel.

Life
Buchanan was third son of David Buchanan (1745-1812), a printer and publisher at Montrose, and was born about 1790. His father was a Glasite and an accomplished classical scholar, who published numerous edition of the Latin classics, which were in high repute for the accuracy.

He was educated at the University of Edinburgh where he was a favourite pupil of Sir John Leslie. About 1812, he began business as a land surveyor, however his inclination toward scientific topics soon led him to devote himself to the profession of a civil engineer. In this capacity, he was engaged in several public works of importance, in construction of harbours an bridges, and made a considerable local reputation.

In 1822, on the invitation of the directors of the School of Arts, he delivered a course of lectures on mechanical philosophy in the Freemasons' Hall, remarkable for the original and striking experiments. Buchanan afterwards gave one or two courses of lectures on natural philosophy, but his increasing business as an engineer interfered with any further educational work.

In 1827, he drew up a report on the South Esk estuary at Montrose in relation to a question then in dispute concerning salmon fishing. This report attracted the attention and gained the marked commendation of Lord-justice-clerk Charles Hope, Lord Granton, then solicitor-general, who afterwards, as long as he remained at the bar, always gave the advice in any case involving scientific evidence to 'secure Buchanan.' Subsequently, in all the important salmon-fishing questions which arose, and which embraced nearly every estuary in Scotland, Buchanan's services were enlisted, the point be generally to determine where the river ended and the sea began. He was considered a legal authority on salmon fishing disputes.

When the tunnel of the Edinburgh and Granton railway was being constructed under the New Town, and the adjacent buildings were considered in imminent danger, Buchanan was commissioned by the Sheriff of Edinburgh to supervise the works on behalf of the city. In 1848, he began the work of erecting the tall chimney, nearly  in height, of the Edinburgh Gasworks, and carried cut a series of experiments to assure its stability. He communicated an account of this work in detail in two papers read before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts. Buchanan was the author of several scientific treatises. He published a 'Report on the Theory and Application of Leslie's Photometer'. He communicated a series of papers in 1851 to the Edinburgh Courant newspaper on pendulum experiments relating to the earth's rotation, and was a regular contributor to the 'Transactions of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts.' He also contributed the article on 'furnaces' to the eighth edition of the 'Encyclopædia Britannica.'

He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was elected president of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts for the session 1647–8.

In the 1830s he was living at 14 Dundas Street in Edinburgh's New Town.

In 1833 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, being proposed by Robert Stevenson. In 1847 he was elected President of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts.

He died of lung disease on 30 Oct. 1852.

Family

David Buchanan (1779-1848), and William Buchanan (1781-1863) were his elder brothers.

He married Charlotte Barnard, sister of Sarah Barnard, the wife of Michael Faraday.

Rhiannon Ryall,"Rhiannon Ryall is the pseudonym of an English-born Australian Wiccan who achieved notoriety for her controversial claims regarding the existence of a group of Wiccans living in England's West Country during the 1940s. These claims were first publicised in 1993 when the English company Capall Bann published Ryall's West Country Wicca: A Journal of the Old Religion, in which she made the claims that when growing up along the borders between the English counties of Devon and Somerset, she was initiated into a local Wiccan tradition that many of the people in the surrounding villages were members of. Claiming that they were ""pre-Gardnerian"", she asserted that her family had not been Wiccan, and as such she was not a hereditary witch, but that aged sixteen, she, like many other boys and girls who were the same age, were taken to the female ""Elders of the village"" who taught them about the Craft.

Ryall continued her claim, asserting that the religion's local followers worshiped the Great Goddess, who was often known as ""the Green Lady"" and who it was believed slept during the winter months, along with a Horned God, whom they referred to as ""Old Horny"". Ryall claimed that the Wiccans met in secretive covens and performed the Drawing Down the Moon rite as a part of their faith,  as well as celebrating five Sabbats annually, which were termed Lady Day (25 March), Beltane (30 April), the Summer Solstice (21 June), Samhain (31 October) and the Winter Solstice (21 December). Describing the group's practices, she claimed that they wore robes, which were ""mainly brown or black, although for festivals they were usually green"" and that they used a cup, a knife, a wand and a dish of salt as their ritual tools. She also claimed that they wrote nothing down, and as such did not make use of a Book of Shadows.

Nonetheless, historians and researchers studying the history of Wicca have been very sceptical of Ryall's claims. Professor Ronald Hutton stated that ""If Ryall's claims had concerned just a coven or two, then they might have been more plausible, but to portray a widespread and deeply entrenched folk religion stretches credulity to breaking point. The possibility must therefore be accepted that, while in Australia, she has devised her own variety of Wicca, which she has tried here to pass off as an old tradition.""

In later years, Ryall went on to write and publish a number of other books on Wicca and magic through Capall Bann, including Celtic Lore and Druid Ritual (1994), Weaving the Web of Magic: A Potpourri of Rituals, Chants, Dances, Webs, Cords, Runes, Talismans and Magical Information (1996) and Teachings of the Wisewomen (2000).

Media

Drama CD
A Drama CD was released with the September 2010 issue of Champion RED and features 3 chapters (separated in 4 acts).

Characters
Saku Sakuraga
 is the main character of the story and is popular among the girls at school. After the incident of his future daughters coming to the present and presenting him with wife candidates, he has difficulty choosing a partner. This is the reason why the daughters always use force to make their parents come together, although Saku is always reluctant to lose his virginity and is constantly trying to run away. It is shown that despite being very indecisive, he is actually very perverted, although this may be due to the constant antics of his daughters. However it is shown that he was less perverted in the past, albeit in a much more childish sense.
Karin
 is Saku's childhood-friend who is bossy and always bullying him around. She is possibly the only normal character in the entire series, despite often being pushed along into the weird antics. She had difficulty coming to terms with her feelings toward Saku, however she managed to finally face it in later chapters. She is a wife candidate for her daughter Kiiro. She has orange hair.
Kuran
 is Saku's cousin who started to live with him in his apartment. She initially confesses to Saku and proposes marriage, which Saku immediately turns down. However this will not stop her since she's a wife candidate for her daughter Hiiro, who gave her the courage she needs. She is womanly, has big breasts, is a good cook, and often spoils Saku. It is shown that Saku played perverted games with her in the past. She has dark blue hair.
Mebuki Kozue
 is Saku and Karin's class representative. Instead of being called , students from their class call her  because of her size. She is very self-conscious about her stature and breast size. When she is too turned on she goes into an ero-mode. Despite this, she hates having indecent things going on in ""her"" world when she is ""normal"". She is a wife candidate for her daughter Moegi. She has pink hair.
Rosemarie
 is a German exorcist. Unlike the other candidates, she is an older woman who appears to have no shame in seducing a young boy because higher-ups ordered her to do so. She cares a lot about her ""future"" daughter Cerulea and hates to be thought of as middle-aged. She is a wife candidate for her daughter Cerulea. She has blonde hair. She first appears in Chapter 21.
Kiiro
 is the daughter of Saku and Karin who comes from the future to make sure that she is born. She is airheaded and ditzy and is fond of curry. It is shown that her in her future that she is rich although initially being poor. Her father in the future is portrayed a rich and arrogant man who pushes his daughter to do well. Her name means yellow.
Hiiro
 is the daughter of Saku and Kuran. Hiiro is about the same age as Kiiro and also her rival. She is usually expressionless and seems to speak in a monotone. It is shown in her future that her family is poor because her father is an alcoholic and a vicious gambler filled with debts who constantly abandons his family to gamble some more. Her name means red.
Moegi
 is the daughter of Saku and Mebuki. She is the only one of the daughters in her teenage years, and often acts rude and will stop at nothing to make her future parents mate. She is arrogant and shameless unlike her mother and often misses out in main roles throughout the story, much to her frustration. It is shown in her future that her family is poor because her father is an alcoholic. She is even willing to commit incest with her father to get him to sleep with her mother (Kiiro tried this in her first appearance, but she did this out of simple naïvety), even going as far as asking him to have a threesome with her and her mother. As of chapter 9 there is evidence that she may have developed a father-complex for Saku during her stay in the present. Her name means green.
Cerulea
 is the daughter of Saku and Rosemarie. She came from the future to castrate her father so she will not be born in the future. This is because of the downfall of her mother's prestige due to her marriage with Saku. But when she was saved from one of her own weapons by Saku she realized that he is not bad and accepted him as her father. She is very innocent and has a pure personality. She has blonde hair like her mother. She first appears in Chapter 14. Her name means blue although in western terms unlike the others, which are all Japanese.
Mirin
 is Karin's mother. She has a happy-go-lucky nature. She seems to have a crush on Saku as well. She appears in Chapter 12.

It is revealed that she is pregnant due to some ""fun"" she had before she arrived, implying that she ""sleeps"" around often. She appears in Chapter 23.
Mobu
 is a classmate of Saku, Karin and Mebuki. She is naïve and dense. She can not keep secrets and when discovering something interesting will always need to share it to the world. She first appears in Chapter 20, where she may have developed a crush on Saku.
Laus
 is Saku's assistant in the future where he does not choose a wife and creates machines. However, an A.I. system he made destroyed the human race. She comes back to the past to help Saku make a choice for the future. She first appears at the end of Chapter 39.

Shepherds Friendly Society,"Shepherds Friendly Society is a UK friendly society and one of the oldest mutual insurers in the world.

It is an incorporated society in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Friendly Societies Act 1992. It has over 100,000 members.

History
The Industrial Revolution led to major changes in society, with village communities diminishing and new towns and industries springing up. As there was no state provision for the poor, mutual aid organisations known as friendly societies were established to help families against hardship brought about illness or death. Such societies began as locally based groups, whose members contributed a small amount each month so that payouts could be made to those in need, with the rest of the money received either saved or invested.

Shepherds Friendly started life as a sickness and benefits society, Ashton Unity, which was formed in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire on Christmas Day in 1826. It was later renamed as the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds, ""loyal"" referring to the Crown and ""shepherds"" to the Nativity of Jesus. Its objects were ""to relieve the sick, bury the dead, and assist each other in all cases of unavoidable distress, so far as in our power lies, and for the promotion of peace and goodwill towards the human race"". It later spread across the country, organised into local branches; like other friendly societies such as the Oddfellows, these were known as 'lodges', and officers wore regalia somewhat similar to those of freemasons. By 1914 the membership had grown to 143,000. The Ancient Shepherds raised substantial funds from its members to support charities, presenting two lifeboats to the RNLI in the 1800s, and supported the Red Cross and YMCA in the Second World War.

Various similar mutual associations have since amalgamated with it, including the Royal Shepherds Sanctuary Benefit Society which was established in Yorkshire in the early 19th century, and the Ancient Order of Shepherds.

Current products
Shepherds Friendly Society has changed from a traditional insurance provider to a modern diversified financial services organisation.
It offers a range of savings, protection and insurance plans for its members.

The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip,"The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is short story writer and novelist George Saunders’s first children's book.

Plot summary
The village of Frip, consisting of three shacks by the sea, relies entirely on the production and sale of goat's milk. The gappers, an unintelligent lifeform shaped like a spiky fish, crawl up from the sea and sit on the backs of the goats. The gappers are so excited about the goats that they cling to them and emit a loud, high-pitched shriek of joy when they are on them. The children of Frip must brush the gappers off of the goats' backs into their gapper sacks and throw them off a cliff back into the sea 8 times a day.  When one slightly less stupid gapper realizes that one of the houses is closer to the sea, they overwhelm the goats in that shack, belonging to Capable and her father, leaving the others untouched and their selfish owners rejoice in their no longer having to deal with the problem.  When Capable asks them for help, they show their true colors.

Luis Palomino,"Luis Vicente Palomino (born October 9, 1980) is a Peruvian-American mixed martial artist who is the current Lightweight champion for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. He also competed in the Lightweight division for the World Series of Fighting and Absolute Championship Berkut. In addition, he previously fought in the featherweight division.

In 2009, Palomino fought for Bellator Fighting Championships, where he competed in their Featherweight Tournament.

Mixed martial arts career

Early career
Palomino began his career with 3–0 record, in the Absolute Fighting Championship promotion, one of which being a victory over future The Ultimate Fighter 7 competitor Jeremy May via unanimous decision.

Palomino's next six fights ended via KO/TKO, whether he won or lost. During this stretch, Palomino had a record of 4–2.

In his final fight prior to joining Bellator, Palomino fought John Mahlow for the XFC Lightweight Championship, in a bout that was featured on the Inside MMA show. Palomino lost the fight via submission (rear naked choke) in the fifth round.

Bellator Fighting Championships
Palomino then joined Bellator to take part in their Bellator Season One: Featherweight Tournament. His opening round fight was against Estevan Payan at Bellator 1. Palomino was knocked down by Payan and almost submitted with a rear naked choke in the first round, but time expired before Payan could finish the fight. The next two rounds were regarded as difficult to score and this led to the verdict of a split decision (29–28, 28–29, 29–28) which didn't go Palomino's way.

Despite his elimination from the featherweight tournament, Palomino stayed with the Bellator promotion and continued in the featherweight division. His opponent at Bellator 6 was Nick Gonzalez and Palomino defeated him via TKO (punches) in the second minute of the first round.

Palomino next faced Troy Gerhart at Bellator 12 in a 150 lb bout and defeated him via unanimous decision (29–28, 29–28, 29–28).

After the first season of Bellator ended, Palomino took a few fights outside of the promotion. Palomino lost his first fight to eventual The Ultimate Fighter winner Jonathan Brookins via submission (rear naked choke) in the second round. Palomino followed the loss up with two victories including wins over Rafael Dias by TKO and Jorge Masvidal via split decision.

In his next Bellator appearance at Bellator 21, Palomino defeated Jose Figueroa via unanimous decision in a lightweight bout.

Palomino then stayed with Bellator into the third season. His first fight of the season was against Yves Edwards at Bellator 24, which he lost via unanimous decision.

Championship Fighting Alliance
Palomino signed with local promotion Championship Fighting Alliance, Palomino quickly made his CFA debut on May 6, 2012 in Miami, Florida against Peter Grimes for the inaugural CFA Featherweight championship at CFA's inaugural event; CFA: The Title. Palomino defeated Grimes by submission due to an armbar at 4:59 of round 4.

Palomino returned at CFA 04: Izquierdo vs. Cenoble on December 17, 2011 in Coral Gables, Florida against well known journeyman Charles Bennett. Palomino was able to use his speed advantage to counter punch the aggressive Bennett and ultimately knocked Bennett out at 3:59 of the first round. Palomino became only the second man to knock Bennet out.

Palomino was scheduled to fight former Maximum Fighting Championship Lightweight Champion Antonio McKee at CFA 06 on April 13, 2012 in Coral Gables, Florida. McKee was forced off the card due to an injury and was replaced by James Warfield, the fight was originally scheduled for the CFA Lightweight Championship but Warfield did not make the required weight of 155 pounds thus rescheduling the fight to a non-title bout. Warfield knocked Palomino down in the first round but Palomino was able to recover and control the rest of his fight by using his unorthodox and fast striking to pick Warfield thus winning by unanimous decision.

Palomino next faced 2x Hero's Grand Prix winner and Strikeforce veteran Gesias Cavalcante at CFA 07: Never Give Up on June 30, 2012 in Coral Gables, Florida. Palomino became the first man to ever finish Cavalcante and he did so via third-round knockout due to punches.

Palomino returned to action at CFA 09 on January 19, 2013 when he faced PRIDE veteran Luiz Firmino for the CFA Lightweight Championship, Palomino lost a unanimous decision after being constantly outgrappled and taken down throughout the fight.

Palomino bounced back from his previous defeat on May 24, 2013 at CFA 11 by knocking out Robert Washington in the first round.

Palomino faced The Ultimate Fighter 8 winner Efrain Escudero at CFA 12 on October 12, 2013. He lost the bout via unanimous decision.

World Series of Fighting
Palomino made his WSOF debut on January 18, 2014 in Hollywood, Florida against Jorge Patino, Palomino won via second-round knockout.

Palomino faced champion Justin Gaethje for the WSOF Lightweight Championship at WSOF 19 on March 28, 2015. He lost the back-and-forth fight via TKO in the third round.

Palomino faced Gaethje in a rematch on September 18, 2015 at WSOF 23.  It was again a back-and-forth battle that Palomino lost via TKO in the second round.

Palomino next entered WSOF's one night Lightweight tournament to determine the number one contender for the Lightweight Championship.  He faced Rich Patishnock in the quarter finals and won via knockout in the first round.  He then faced Brian Foster in the semifinals and lost via TKO in the second round.

Absolute Championship Berkut
Palomino faced Chechen fighter Musa Khamanaev on January 13, 2017 at ACB 51. He won the fight via TKO in the second round.

In the second fight he faced Marcos Vinicius Schmitz on May 20, 2017 at ACB 61. He won the fight via unanimous decision.

Palomino faced Yusuf Raisov on August 19, 2017 at ACB 67. He lost the fight via unanimous decision.

Bare-knuckle boxing
After signing a three-fight contract with the BKFC, Palomino made his debut in bare-knuckle boxing against Elvin Brito at BKFC 10 on February 15, 2020. Palomino won the fight via unanimous decision and advanced to the four-man BKFC Super Welterweight Tournament finals.

Palomino was initially scheduled to face Jim Alers at BKFC 11 on March 14, 2020 for the Lightweight Championship, but the event was postponed to take place on June 20, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was subsequently postponed yet again and two weeks before the re-scheduled date July 24, 2020, Alers withdrew after his camp member tested positive for COVID-19 and was replaced by Isaac Vallie-Flagg. Palomino claimed the title via first-minute knockout.

The bout with Alers was then rebooked to take place at BKFC 14 on November 13, 2020. Palomino successfully defended his championship via first-minute knockout.

In his second title defense attempt, Palomino faced Tyler Goodjohn at BKFC 18 on June 26, 2021. Palomino retained his title and won the bout via unanimous decision.

He next faced Dat Nguyen at BKFC 22 on November 12, 2021. He successfully defended the title via unanimous decision.

Downtown Hinsdale Historic District,"The Downtown Hinsdale Historic District is a set of seventy-three buildings and one park in Hinsdale, Illinois.

History

The region was platted by William Robbins, the founder of Hinsdale, in 1865. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's (CB&Q) passenger station prompted several small businesses to develop across the street. Fifty-eight of the listed buildings were built for commerce, three for government, and nine for transportation. The remaining building is a theater. The shops are densely clustered in orthogonal patterns, and are mostly found on the south side of the railway tracks. The government buildings, including the Village Hall (Hinsdale Memorial Building) and U.S. Post Office are on the north side.

An article entitled ""Hinsdale the Beautiful"" in Campbell's Illustrated Journal prompted city officials to further beautify the city. The first major project was a state-of-the-art train station, which was designed by CB&Q architect Walter Theodore Krausch. The station became a model for the future construction of other stations on the line. The region north of the tracks became the next target, focusing on the Railroad Park (modern day Burlington Park). Commercial demand spiked in the early 20th century, even causing some gablefront residential buildings to be rezoned as commercial. The 1200-seat Hinsdale Theater was constructed in 1925 for $160,000. Chain retailers began to move into the downtown district starting in the 1920s, starting with a Loblaw food chain in 1929 (which was purchased in 1932 by the Jewel Tea Company). A Piggly Wiggly and a Walgreens also moved in during this period. In the 1920s, the city of Hinsdale overhead plans by a local car dealership to build the largest automobile garage ""east of the Mississippi"". To curb this plan, the city bought the proposed site and constructed a building dedicated to those who served and died in World War I. Construction on the Memorial Building finished in 1927.

Hinsdale is notorious for the aggressive teardown policies pursued by real estate agencies in its residential districts, but the commercial district has remain intact. The earliest buildings are on First and Washington Streets, which date from the 1880s and are in the Late Victorian, Italianate, and Queen Anne Styles. Colonial and Renaissance Revivals featured in early 20th century buildings until the Hinsdale Plan of 1923 dictated the use of Georgian Revival architecture. Eight of the properties were built after 1955. The district is served by three asphalt-paved parking lots.

Mr. Vampire IV,"Mr. Vampire IV, also known as Mr. Vampire Saga Four, (Chinese: 殭屍叔叔) is a 1988 Hong Kong comedy horror film directed by Ricky Lau and produced by Sammo Hung and Jessica Chan. The film is the fourth of a series of five films directed by Ricky Lau in the Mr. Vampire franchise. Mr. Vampire and its sequels were released as part of the jiangshi cinematic boom in Hong Kong during the 1980s. The Chinese title of the film literally translates to Uncle Vampire.

Plot
In the rural countryside, a bespectacled Taoist priest called Four-eyed Taoist is always at odds with his neighbour, a Buddhist monk called Master Yat-yau. Their respective students, Kar-lok and Ching-ching, are friendly towards each other. The Taoist and Buddhist play pranks on each other.

One day, a convoy of soldiers escorting a coffin passes by their houses. Inside the convoy is Four-eyed's junior, Taoist Crane, and Crane's four disciples, as well as a young prince and his bodyguards. Four-eyed and Yat-yau learn from Crane that there is a jiangshi (Chinese ""hopping"" vampire) in the coffin, and the convoy is on its way to the capital to let the emperor inspect the jiangshi.

During a thunderstorm that night, rainwater washes away the magical charms on the coffin and the vampire breaks out, becoming more powerful after being struck by a bolt of lightning. The vampire starts attacking everyone in the convoy and infecting them with the ""vampire virus"", causing them to transform into vampires as well after a short time. Taoist Crane remains behind to hold off the vampire while the prince and his attendant flee towards the houses.

At this critical moment, Four-eyed and Yat-yau both decide to put aside their differences and focus on destroying the vampires.

Think Small,"Think Small was one of the most famous ads in the advertising campaign for the Volkswagen Beetle, art-directed by Helmut Krone. The copy for Think Small was written by Julian Koenig at the Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) agency in 1959. Doyle Dane Bernbach's Volkswagen Beetle campaign was ranked as the best advertising campaign of the twentieth century by Ad Age, in a survey of North American advertisements. Koenig was followed by many other writers during Krone's art-directorship of the first 100 ads of the campaign, most notably Bob Levenson. The campaign has been considered so successful that it ""did much more than boost sales and build a lifetime of brand loyalty [...] The ad, and the work of the ad agency behind it, changed the very nature of advertising—from the way it's created to what you see as a consumer today.""

Background
Fifteen years after World War II, the United States had become a world and consumer superpower; and cars began to be built for growing families with Baby Boomer children and ""Americans obsessed with muscle cars"". The Beetle, a ""compact, strange-looking automobile"", was manufactured in a plant built by the Nazis in Wolfsburg, Germany, which was perceived to make it more challenging to sell the vehicle (since the car was designed in Nazi Germany). Automobile advertisements back then focused on providing as much information as possible to the reader instead of persuading the reader to purchase a product, and the advertisements were typically rooted more in fantasy than in reality.

Campaign
Helmut Krone came up with the design and headline for ""Think Small"" simultaneously. Krone teamed up with Julian Koenig to develop the ""Think Small"" and ""Lemon"" ads for Volkswagen under the supervision of William Bernbach. DDB built a print campaign that focused on the Beetle's form, which was smaller than most of the cars being sold at the time. This unique focus in an automobile advertisement brought wide attention to the Beetle. DDB had ""simplicity in mind, contradicting the traditional association of automobiles with luxury"". Print advertisements for the campaign were filled mostly with white space, with a small image of the Beetle shown, which was meant to emphasize its simplicity and minimalism, and the text and fine print that appeared at the bottom of the page listed the advantages of owning a small car.

The creative execution broke with convention in a number of ways. Although the layout used the traditional format - image, headline and three-column body were retained, other differences were subtle yet sufficient to make the advertisement stand out. It used a sans-serif font at a time when serif fonts were normal. It included a full-stop after the tagline ""Think Small.""  The body-copy was full of widows and orphans - all designed to give the ad a natural and honest feel. The image of the car was placed in the top left-hand corner and angled in a way that directed the reader's attention toward the headline. Finally, the ad was printed in black and white, at a time when full colour advertisements were widely used. Over time, the layout changed but the essential executional elements were used consistently to give each iteration exhibited a sense of a ""house style"".

Books
A 1967 promotional book titled Think Small was distributed as a giveaway by Volkswagen dealers. Charles Addams, Bill Hoest, Virgil Partch, Gahan Wilson and other top cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with amusing automotive essays by such humorists as H. Allen Smith, Roger Price and Jean Shepherd. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

The campaign has been the subject of a number of books, with serious scholarly analysis of the campaign's key success factors, including: Think Small: The Story of those Volkswagen Ads by Frank Rowsome (1970);  Think Small: The Story of the World's Greatest Ad (2011) by Dominik Imseng;  and Thinking Small: The Long, Strange Trip of the Volkswagen Beetle (2012) by Andrea Hiott;

László Pyber,"László Pyber (born 8 May 1960 in Budapest) is a Hungarian mathematician. He is a researcher at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics, Budapest. He works in combinatorics and group theory.

Biography 
Pyber received his Ph.D. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1989 under the direction of László Lovász and Gyula O.H. Katona with the thesis Extremal Structures and Covering Problems.

In 2007, he was awarded the Academics Prize by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

In 2017, he was the recipient of an ERC Advanced Grant.

Mathematical contributions
Pyber has solved a number of conjectures in graph theory. In 1985, he proved the conjecture of Paul Erdős and Tibor Gallai that edges of a simple graph with n vertices can be covered with at most n-1 circuits and edges. In 1986, he proved the conjecture of Paul Erdős that a graph with n vertices and its complement can be covered with n2/4+2 cliques.

He has also contributed to the study of permutation groups. In 1993, he provided an upper bound for the order of a 2-transitive group of degree n not containing An avoiding the use of the classification of finite simple groups. Together with Tomasz Łuczak, Pyber proved the conjecture of McKay that for every ε>0, there is a constant C such that C randomly chosen elements invariably generate the symmetric group Sn with probability greater than 1-ε.

Pyber has made fundamental contributions in enumerating finite groups of a given order n. In 1993, he proved that if the prime power decomposition of n is n=p1g1  ⋯ pkgk and μ=max(g1,...,gk), then the number of groups of order n is at mostIn 2004, Pyber settled several questions in subgroup growth by completing the investigation of the spectrum of possible subgroup growth types.

In 2011, Pyber and Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain obtained a surprisingly explicit formula for the number of random elements needed to generate a finite d-generator group with high probability. They also explored related questions for profinite groups and settled several open problems.

In 2016, Pyber and Endre Szabó proved that in a finite simple group L of Lie type, a generating set A of L either grows, i.e., |A3| ≥ |A|1+ε for some ε depending only on the Lie rank of L, or A3=L. This implies that diameters of Cayley graphs of finite simple groups of bounded rank are polylogarithmic in the size of the group, partially resolving a well-known conjecture of László Babai.

Tournament

Singles
In the singles saw a relatively low number of top players as only 11 of the top 20 players were present compared to 16 the previous year, adding to only 5 top ten players were present compared to 9 the previous year. In the first round the top 8 seeds receive a bye and the action saw Nicolás Almagro, Philipp Kohlschreiber came back from a first set loss to win in three. While two-time champion and one of two former champions 9th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero made quick work of Marcel Granollers with a 6–0 6–3 victory. He was joined by other seeds David Ferrer, Tomáš Berdych and Juan Mónaco who earned his first victory over Jarkko Nieminen. And high-profiled names David Nalbandian and Richard Gasquet also made it through, the only seed to fall was 16th seed Marcos Baghdatis who fell to Albert Montañés in straight sets. The first players who went through the third round were seeded players Fernando Verdasco, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and Tomáš Berdych who won in straight sets, while 4th seed Marin Čilić grinded to win in three over Igor Andreev. They were followed in by 5 Spaniards led by defending champion Rafael Nadal, two-time champion Juan Carlos Ferrero, David Ferrer and Tommy Robredo who all won in straight sets and Albert Montañés. Top seed Novak Djokovic also made in through in straight sets. The second round produced major upsets mainly involving the Germans as clay-court specialist and 14th seed Juan Mónaco fell to Michael Berrer 6–4, 6–4, world no. 4 Andy Murray fell in just over an hour to Philipp Kohlschreiber and 15th seed Jürgen Melzer falling to Philipp Petzschner. In the final match of the second round saw David Nalbandian upsetting 7th seed Mikhail Youzhny 4–6, 6–3, 7-6(5), when Youzhny failed to serve it out at 5–4 in the final set.

Strelitzia juncea,"Strelitzia juncea, the rush-leaved strelitzia or narrow-leaved bird of paradise, is a monocotyledonous flowering plant that is indigenous to South Africa. This drought-resistant Strelitzia occurs sparingly near Uitenhage, Patensie and just north of Port Elizabeth. It is threatened in part by illegal removal for horticultural purposes. This species is thought to be one of the most frost-resistant of the genus Strelitzia.

Other common names include strelitzia, bird of paradise, or crane flower though these names are also collectively applied to other species in the genus Strelitzia.

Proof Positive (Greene story),"""Proof Positive"" is a short story by Graham Greene written in 1930 and first published in 1931 as the winner of the first prize (10 Guineas) in a newspaper ghost story competition. .

Publication
The story was collected in Greene's 1947 collection Nineteen Stories.

Inspiration
The story was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"" (1845).

Plot
The story concerns a meeting of the 'local Psychical Society' at which guest speaker, Major Weaver, claims to have 'proof positive' that 'the spirit does not die when the body dies'. The Major appears ill and carries a handkerchief with an overpoweringly sweet odor. As he speaks his words become increasingly disjointed until finally it degenerates into an 'odd jangling note' as he collapses back into his chair.  A doctor from the audience rushes onstage, discards the handkerchief and pronounces him dead. As another more unpleasant smell can be detected the doctor whispers ""The man must have been dead a week...""

Radio adaptation
The story was dramatized for The Black Mass radio series broadcast on KPFA on June 3, 1964.

Pollinator Partnership,"The Pollinator Partnership or P2 is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization headquartered in San Francisco, California that works to protect the health of managed and native pollinating animals that are vital to wildland and agricultural ecosystems. The Pollinator Partnership’s mission of environmental stewardship and pollinator protection is achieved through conservation, policy, education, and research. Signature initiatives include the NAPPC (North American Pollinator Protection Campaign), National Pollinator Week, and EcoRegional Planting Guides  that allow local citizens to plant gardens that provide habitats for important pollinating species.

Background and history
The Pollinator Partnership was founded as the Coevolution Institute (CoE) in 1997. The early mission of the organization was to promote research, outreach, and education relating to pollinating species and their floral associations. The importance of pollinators has been realized more vividly in recent years. The 1999 Convention on Biological Diversity SÃO PAULO DECLARATION ON POLLINATORS  brought to light both the roles that pollinators play in the daily lives of all human beings and their status as a group of species at risk.

Since 1997 P2 has grown and achieved national status as a leader in pollinator conservation. The multifaceted approach of targeting stakeholders ranging from farmers, growers, policy makers, industry, academia, education, and the general public has allowed P2 to launch parallel projects that work towards a common goal – protecting and promoting pollinator populations.

Partnerships and collaboration
P2 has many strong partnerships with institutions, organizations, corporations, and individuals that share a general concern for the conservation of biological diversity and the species that provide essential ecosystem services. The targeted focus on pollinators, however, is unique and is complemented by working relationships and alliances with other conservation institutions. P2 has worked closely with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to develop the EcoRegional Planting Guides. P2's conservation concern is relevant to a subset of the invertebrate species promoted by the Xerces Society.

Corporate partnerships with Burt's Bees and Häagen-Dazs have helped P2 to promote and preserve honey bee populations within the United States through their respective “Honey Bee Health” and “HD Loves Honey Bees”  campaigns. P2 has also partnered with food producers and retailers such as Whole Foods Market, World Foods, Wyman's of Maine, and The Great Northern Roasting Company.

Scientific advisory panel
The conservation work of the Pollinator Partnership is backed by scientific evidence on pollinator decline. Steve Buchmann, Ph.D., co-author of The Forgotten Pollinators, serves as P2's staff scientist. The P2 scientific advisory board includes famed entomologist E.O. Wilson, evolutionary ecologist Daniel Janzen, Ph.D.; entomologist May Berenbaum, Ph.D.; botanist Peter Raven, conservation biologist and president of Stanford's Center for Conservation Biology Paul R. Ehrlich, Ph.D.; chemical ecologist Thomas Eisner, Ph.D.; biologist Don Kennedy, Ph.D.; and scientist and natural history writer Adrian Forsyth, Ph.D.

Swallow Hill Music Association,"Swallow Hill Music is a Denver, Colorado based non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and preserving roots, acoustic and folk music. The school is inspired by the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago. Swallow Hill hosts hundreds of concerts a year ranging from national acts, such as Sheryl Crow and Josh Ritter, to many talented local artists and former students.

History 

In 1962, Harry Tuft created the Denver Folklore Center in the Swallow Hill neighborhood of Denver, Colorado.  The DFC quickly became the place to be, and in no time grew to be one square block. It included a music store, repair shop, music store, and concert hall.

In 1971, the Denver Folklore Center Concert Hall was built and through most of the 70s experienced exceptional success. The concert hall brought in artists like Taj Mahal, Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt, Bette White and many others, establishing a solid reputation to a business that had already been acclaimed by many. The late Rocky Mountain News can be quoted as calling the DFC “a place of good reputation among artists in many other cities.” 

Unfortunately during the late 70s the neighborhood that surrounded the DFC began to decline dramatically. Tuft and many of the centers supporters got together to come up with a solution that would help support local folk music and the artists that inhabit it. This solution is now known as the non-profit Swallow Hill Music Association. This new organization would soon relieve the DFC of both the concert hall and music school.

In the 80s, Swallow Hill and the DFC made the move from the old location to a new location at 440 South Broadway. One problem with the new complex was there was not enough space to home a concert hall. Therefore, Swallow Hill rented numerous concert venues around the Denver area to accommodate their concerts. Another big moment during this era for Swallow Hill was the formation of the first newsletter titled Simple Gifts.

During the 90s, Swallow Hill drastically expanded in a very short amount of time. The organization began the decade remodeling their new Pearl Street building, forming their first choir, Thursday night jams, and the new Folkathon.

As their school and opportunities began to cover more ground, so did the population of supporters and customers. Soon the new Pearl Street building could no longer hold the capacity of people joining the organization. Thus their current home at 71 East Yale was opened to the public on the day of the organizations 20th anniversary.

Julie Davis School of Music

The Swallow Hill Music school was founded in 1979. In 2002, Swallow Hill Music made the decision to honor one of their most inspiring of colleagues, Julie Davis, by naming the music school after her. Davis became heavily involved in improving the school in 1984, and served as the director from 1986 to 1995. Currently, the school hosts 40,000 students a year and has classes for just about every level, genre, and age group.

Romain-Octave Pelletier I,"Romain-Octave Pelletier I (sometimes spelled Peltier) (9 September 1843 – 4 March 1927) was a Canadian organist, pianist, composer, writer on music, and music educator.

Early life and career
Born in Montreal, Pelletier was a member of a prominent musical family. Three of his sons had successful musical careers: Frédéric Pelletier, Romain Pelletier, and Victor Pelletier. His grandson, Romain-Octave Pelletier II, was a well known violinist. His elder brother, Orphir Pelletier, was a composer and organist at St. Patrick's Basilica, Montreal. Largely self-taught, it is from Orphir that he received his only early music lessons. He later studied for two years in Europe during the early 1870s after having worked for almost 15 years as a church organist.

In 1857, at the age of 15, Pelletier succeeded Jean-Chrysostome Brauneis II as organist at Saint-Jacques Cathedral. He remained there for the next ten years, during which time he studied law and obtained certification as a notary. He notably officiated the marriage license of violinist Frantz Jehin-Prume, whom he accompanied numerous times in recital, and mezzo-soprano Rosita del Vecchio in 1866.

In 1866-1867 Pelletier spent some months in Hartford, Connecticut where he made the acquaintance of organist Samuel Prowse Warren. From 1867-1875 he served as organist at the Church of St James-the-Less on St-Denis St where he caused some controversy for daring to play works by Protestant composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and Felix Mendelssohn. In 1869 he married, after which he began actively teaching piano and organ lessons privately.

Studies in Europe and later career
Pelletier spent almost two years touring Europe in 1871-1872. During that time he studied under George Cooper, William Thomas Best, and John Baptiste Calkin in London, Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens in Brussels, and with pianist Antoine François Marmontel and organist Louis Lebel in Paris. He notably performed works by Bach in the presence of Charles-Marie Widor at the Église Saint-Sulpice in 1872. He later sojourned to Europe again in 1900 in the company of organ builders Joseph-Claver Casavant and Samuel-Marie Casavant.

After returning to Montreal in 1872, Pelletier resumed teaching and playing the organ at St James the lesser. He taught solfège at the École normale Jacques-Cartier from 1876 to 1907. He served as interim president of the Académie de musique du Québec on several occasions (1884-5, 1894-5, 1902-4, 1909–10, and 1915–16) in addition to teaching at a number of religious schools in Montreal. He was once again appointed organist of St James Cathedral in 1887 (at the St-Joseph Chapel until the inauguration of the new cathedral on Dominion Square in 1894) and remained in that post until 1923.

In 1904 Pelletier became one of the original music faculty members at McGill University, where he taught piano up into the latter years of his life. In 1919 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Université de Montréal. Among his many notable students during his long career are: Alcibiade Béique, Albertine Caron-Legris, Victoria Cartier, Claude Champagne, Édouard Clarke, Alexandre-M. Clerk, Jean Dansereau, Jean Deslauriers, Joseph-Daniel Dussault, J.-J. Gagnier, Henri Gagnon, Alfred La Liberté, Alfred Lamoureux, Alphonse Lavallée-Smith, Émery Lavigne, Ernest Lavigne, Antonio Létourneau, Clarence Lucas, Alfred Mignault, Albertine Morin-Labrecque, Joseph Piché, William Reed, Léon Ringuet, Amédée Tremblay, and Alice Vinette.

"Ilinden, Blagoevgrad Province","Ilinden ( ) is a village in Hadzhidimovo Municipality, in Blagoevgrad Province, Bulgaria. It is located in a mountainous area, on the northern slopes the Stargach mountain. It is 14 kilometers southwest of Hadzidimovo Municipal Center and 18 kilometers southeast of Gotse Delchev. The climate is transitional Mediterranean with mountain influence with summer minimum and winter maximum of rainfall. The average annual rainfall is about 700 mm. The Mutnitsa River flows through the village. The soils are predominantly humus-carbonate.

History
The old name of the village before 1951 is Libyahovo. According to professor Ivan Duridanov, the settlement name Libyahovo with an earlier form, Lyubyahovo, comes from the personal name Lyubyah. According to a local legend, the name comes from the name of one Ali Bey, and according to another, from the great love (lyubov in Bulgarian), uniting his inhabitants against the Ottoman rule during the Ottoman rule.

There are ruins of an ancient fortress Gradishte, located 2 km east of the village.

In the nineteenth century, Libyahovo was a large village with a predominant Bulgarian population, belonging to the Nevrokop kaza of the Seres sanjak. The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was built in 1828–1831.  In the Ethnography of the Villanets of Adrianople, Monastir and Thessaloniki, published in Constantinople in 1878 and reflecting the statistics of the male population of 1873, Lubiahovo is cited as a village with 253 households and 850 Bulgarians. 

In 1889, Stefan Verkovic (Topographical-Ethnographic Outline of Macedonia) notes Libyahovo as a village with 245 Bulgarian houses.

In 1891 Vasil Kanchov visited Nevrokopsko and left interesting travel notes for Libyahovo. Here's what he writes:

""Libyahovo has a very nice view. It is located on a small tributary of the Burovitsa River. There is a wonderful view from the top where I was. Above it you can see cultivated fields and meadows below. It counts 300 Bulgarian houses. The peasants were awakened as those from Gaytaninovo. Since 1870 they have a Bulgarian school. They stood in the ranks of the first fighters in the fight against the Greek bishop, but in 1887, threatened greatly by the military commandant at Nevrocop, recognized the authority of the bishop. This year they renounced it. [8] ""
According to the statistical surveys of Vasil Kunchov (""Macedonia. Ethnography and Statistics""), by 1900 the village population had a total of 1720 people, of which 1660 were Christian and 60 were Gypsies.

According to the secretary of the Bulgarian Exarchate Dimitar Mishev (""La Macédoine et sa Population Chrétienne""), in 1905 the Christian population of Libiahovo consisted of 1,800 Bulgarian exarchists and 18 Gypsies. There is a Bulgarian elementary school in the village with 1 teacher and 65 students.

At the outbreak of the Balkan War in 1912, 55 people from Libyahovo volunteered in the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps.

Economy, transportation

The village is very close to a border crossing with Greece on the way between Razlog and Drama, Greece on a secondary road №19. There aren't any industrial subjects in it. There are no educational institutions in Ilinden, though in the past there existed a school.

Religion

The people in the village are predominantly Orthodox Christian. The first church is built ""Assumption of Holy Virgin Mary"" in 1831 year and is yet functional. There is another Orthodox church ""St Atanasios the Great"", built in the recent years.

Verdugo Hills Cemetery,"The Verdugo Hills of Peace Pioneer Cemetery, or Verdugo Hills Cemetery, located in Tujunga, Los Angeles, California, opened in 1922 and closed in 1976.

History
The Los Angeles Office of Historic Resources describes the four-acre cemetery:

By the early 1970s the cemetery had fallen into disrepair, according to the Los Angeles Times, and lost its license in 1976.

Verdugo Hills Cemetery landslide, 1978
On February 10, 1978, after days of torrential rains, a massive landslide occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains foothills above Tujunga.  The result was the unearthing of a large section of the cemetery and corpses being strewn throughout the area.  The rain had been pouring into holes made by gophers and saturated the earth. When the slope gave way, rotted caskets broke open, and their contents were carried away.

According to Thomas Noguchi's book Coroner, some 100 bodies were sent plunging into homes, businesses, and city streets. He even states that one such body was wedged into the entrance of a supermarket. The resulting task of trying to identify the remains and rebury them under their correct markers is documented in the book. When they arrived, bodies were everywhere. Some, he states, were ""grotesquely standing upright"".

The City of Los Angeles repaired the grounds, but heavy rain unearthed more corpses in 1980.

Restoration 
Friends of Verdugo Hills Cemetery are volunteering every 3rd Saturday of the month in effort to renew and restore the cemetery.

Joseph Chiles,"Joseph Ballinger Chiles (July 16, 1810 – June 25, 1885), later known by his Spanish name José B. Chiles, was a Californian ranchero, military officer, and entrepreneur. Born in Kentucky, Chiles served as a colonel in the U.S. Army during the Seminole Wars, before eventually immigrating to Alta California, where he became a Mexican citizen and acquired multiple rancho grants in the Napa Valley and Sacramento Valley.

California
Widowed, he placed his children with relatives to join the Bartleson-Bidwell Party of 1841, the first wagon train to enter Mexican Alta California over the Sierra Nevadas.

He returned east in 1842 and subsequently led seven more wagon trains into California. At Fort Hall he met Joseph Rutherford Walker whom he convinced to lead half the settlers with him traveling in wagons back to California down the Humboldt River. Chiles led the rest in a pack train party up the Malheur River and on south to California via the Pit and Sacramento Rivers. Walker's party in 1843 also abandoned their wagons and finished getting to California by pack train.

In 1844, Chiles received Mexican citizenship and was granted the Rancho Catacula in Napa Valley. He operated a grist mill and a ferry across the Sacramento River.

In 1850, he also purchased part of the Rancho Laguna de Santos Calle. The area is the present day site of Davis, California.

Nick Knight (Forever Knight),"Nick Knight (born Nicholas de Brabant) is the main character of the Canadian television series Forever Knight, and its precursor 1989 television movie Nick Knight. He also appears in three novels, A Stirring of Dust by Susan Sizemore, Intimations of Mortality by Susan M. Garrett, and These Our Revels by Anne Hathaway Nayne.

The character's backstory is revealed piecemeal, primarily through the flashback scenes that appear in most episodes of the television series. He was born circa A.D. 1200; and, in many episodes, employs the name ""Nicolas de Brabant"", suggesting that he comes from the Duchy of Brabant in the Low Countries. He was born of a noble family, and trained as a knight. After being falsely accused of murder, he chose to fight in the Crusades to escape nearly certain conviction. On his return to Europe in A.D. 1228, he was seduced by a vampire in disguise, Janette DuCharme, who introduced him to her master, Lucien LaCroix. LaCroix offered Knight immortality, which he accepted, becoming a vampire. After spending centuries hunting and killing to sustain himself, Knight rejected the vampire lifestyle, and became a homicide detective in the Metropolitan Police in order to redeem himself.

Knight was played by Australian actor Rick Springfield in the movie, and by Welsh actor Geraint Wyn Davies in the series.

Fictional biography

Early life

Nick Knight was born Nicholas de Brabant, of a noble family from the Duchy of Brabant circa A.D. 1200. Trained as a knight under Sir Raymond DeLabarre, he was sent to Wales on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church to investigate pagan activities. While there, he fell in love with a Welsh noblewoman, Gwyneth. DeLabarre killed Gwyneth in order to quell a pending pagan revolt, and blamed Knight for her death. Knight was offered to fight in the Crusades instead of facing a trial he could not win, and accepted the offer. After several years spent in the Holy Land, Knight returned to Europe in A.D. 1228, disillusioned and embittered, and became a drunkard.

While drunk, he meets Janette DuCharme, who intrigues him with the lure of immortality. She then introduces him to Lucien LaCroix, and Knight discovers that Janette and LaCroix are vampires and wanted to ""bring him across"" (make him a vampire). LaCroix tempts him with the prospect of having eternal life and youth as well as power beyond his imagination, and Knight accepts. Nicholas is brought to the catacombs of Paris for his first ""feeding"", in which Nicholas must kill a mortal for their blood. After some brief hesitation, Knight kills the first of what would become many victims, and fully embraces life as a vampire.

Although it is never mentioned in any episode, writer James D. Parriott said that he wrote a backstory explaining the reasons for this disillusionment. In this backstory, Knight was captured by Muslims and spent several years being tortured in prison. This caused him to lose faith in God, and left him vulnerable to suggestion by Janette and LaCroix.

As a vampire 

Upon becoming a vampire, Knight gained several supernatural abilities and weaknesses, many commonly associated with vampires, and some original to the series.

As a vampire, Knight possess enhanced senses; infrared vision, enhanced hearing, superhuman strength, preternatural speed and agility, is able to regenerate critical wounds over small amounts of time, and is able to fly. His body is also very resilient to the elements, being immune to the effects of cold, poison, illnesses and diseases, and his heart beats only once per 10 minutes. One of his most useful powers is the ability to perform hypnosis on some, but not all people (those able to resist hypnosis are known as resisters), which will help several times during his work with the Metropolitan Toronto Police. Amongst his weakness are a deadly aversion to sunlight, violent allergic reactions to foods (but not all liquids), an allergy to smelling garlic, a compulsion to look away from Holy objects and religious symbols, and coming into contact with crucifixes and holy water will cause his flesh to burn. Like others vampires in fiction, Knight is immortal, he does not physically age beyond the point of his vampire transformation nor is he vulnerable to the effects of old age or natural death, but can be killed by exposure to sunlight, having a wooden stake driven through his heart, fire, or decapitation.

Knight appears human in normal circumstances, although he rarely perspires – and when he does, he does not perspire sweat, but rather blood – and his skin is cold to the touch. Knight will reveal his vampire traits when threatened, or when becoming aggressive. This is known as vamping out by the fans of the series, but it is never referred as such during the series. When taking a vampire aspect, Knight's eyes turn yellow, and bares the stereotypical vampire fangs. Amongst the common vampire traits found in fiction, Knight does not possess the ability to shapeshift into a bat, and is not inclined to sleep in a coffin. He also does not lose any of his vampire abilities upon at dawn, although exposure to sunlight is still fatal.

In the Forever Knight universe, vampires rarely stay more than a few years in one place in order to keep their true identifies concealed. He thus engages in centuries of killings and murders accompanied by Janette and LaCroix. Janette and Knight were lovers, but Janette ended it; while Knight was initially devastated, he eventually accepted her decision and remain on good terms with her. After centuries of indiscriminate killing, Knight started to feel guilt and resolves to only kill those who deserved death. He also has regrets over his choice to become a vampire, and desires to regain his mortality and humanity. Knight will spend most of the Forever Knight series trying to find a way to become human once again. This is met with amusement from other vampires, but LaCroix finds these thoughts unacceptable; this difference of opinions will be the source of great conflicts between the two over the span of the entire series.

Over the series Knight is seen with several historical figures such as Joan of Arc, Arthur Conan Doyle, Ludwig van Beethoven, Jack the Ripper, Grigori Rasputin and Adolf Hitler. LaCroix and Knight, being bonded by blood, also share a psychic bond and are able to sense each other over short distances, and predisposes Knight to Lacroix's suggestions (it does not make him his mental slave however). His long life also allowed him to master several languages in addition to his native French – Cantonese, English, German, Italian, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.

Police career 

By 1992, Nick had re-established himself in Toronto, Canada, and works for the Metropolitan Toronto Police as Homicide Detective Nicholas (Nick) Knight as a way to seek penance and atone for his past behaviour. While he still fights his hunger for human blood, Knight has not killed anyone for blood in the last 100 years, and now subsists on cow blood instead. His policing work also allows him to reconnect with human society.

His superior officer, Captain Joseph Stonetree, initially had misgivings about Knight, but tolerated him because he turned out to be an excellent detective. Originally, Knight worked alone, but was eventually partnered with Detective Donald Schanke, his polar opposite in terms of personality and approach to police work, but of equal competence. The two initially butted heads, but came to respect and trust each other, essentially becoming bona fide ""buddy cops"". The duo also worked with Dr. Natalie Lambert, a coroner.

Lambert is one of the few persons who discovered the true identity of Knight during the series – after a bomb explosion injures Knight, she finds him without any injury, and catches him drinking the blood samples in her lab. Nick tried to hypnotize her, but fails as she is one of the ""resisters"". Lambert is fascinated by his nature, and agrees to both keep his identity a secret, and help him regain his humanity.

In Toronto, Nick would meet both LaCroix and Janette. He tries to destroy LaCroix by driving a flaming stake through his heart, but LaCroix manages to escape permanent death through means which are never revealed. LaCroix and Knight reach an uneasy truce, where LaCroix stops trying to actively thwart Knight's plan to become mortal again, but still tries to convince Nick to embrace his vampire nature as he once did. Knight also re-establishes a friendship with Janette, who now runs a nightclub, called The Raven, which is frequented by both humans and vampires.

After the death of Donald Schanke in a plane accident, Nick is teamed up with Tracy Vetter, a recently promoted and capable detective who is often willing to take risks in order to prove herself. Like Schanke, Vetter was unaware that Nick was a vampire, but she was aware of the existence of vampires, having become friends with Javier Vachon, a member of the Toronto vampire community who was acquainted with Nick. Nick knew of Vetter's knowledge of both Vachon and vampires, but refused to reveal his own vampiric nature to her.

End of series 

In the last half of the final season, Nick began to lose ground in his quest for humanity. Natalie, who was developing strong romantic feelings for Nick grew impatient at Nick's lack of progress. On one night, Nick tried to hypnotize a suspect, but the trance was broken and a firefight occurred. The suspect shot Nick, but the bullets went through him and hit Tracy instead. Nick killed the suspect while displayed his vampire features, to a shocked Tracy who displayed disappointment that Nick never trusted her with this secret.

Tracy is rushed to the hospital, but she was in critical condition and Nick considered turning her into a vampire, feeling guilty for what happened. Natalie chastises Nick for being willing to bring Tracy over, while he always refused her. Nick decides against, and Tracy dies from her wounds. In the same evening, Nick stops by The Raven to find LaCroix closing the club, explaining it was time for him to move on as the investigation of the night's event will expose him as a vampire, and will leave Toronto with or without Nick. Nick wishes to move on, but Natalie doesn't want him to leave and insists that Nick bring her across. Nick reluctantly agrees.

Nick however tries to become human by drinking Natalie's blood, as Janette did. However, he draws too much blood and is forced to either complete the process, bringing Natalie over, or let her die. Not able to condemn Natalie to a life as a vampire, he decides to let her die and take his own life as well, reasoning that he will be reunited with her in the afterlife, and that God would forgive his many sins. Nick realizes that LaCroix had been his best friend in all these years, and hands LaCroix a wooden stake.

LaCroix raises the stake, and the camera focuses elsewhere, leaving the final fate of Nick deliberately ambiguous to allow for the series to be picked up and continued.

Charles H. Watson,"Charles H. Watson (8 October 1877 – 24 December 1962) was a Seventh-day Adventist minister and administrator. He was President of the General Conference from 1930 to 1936.

Watson was born in Australia on 8 October 1877 to a farming family who lived near Yambuk, Victoria.

On 23 March 1898 he married his neighbor and childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Mary Shanks. In 1900 his family was introduced to Seventh-day Adventist doctrines.  Charles resisted accepting these doctrines until 1902, when he found no biblical support for Sunday observance and was baptized by W. A. Hennig. Watson had been a successful wool buyer, but quit the business in 1907 to attend Australasian Missionary College in order to study for the ministry.  He graduated from this school in 1909 and was ordained into Seventh-day Adventist ministry on 14 September 1912.

Watson was appointed president of the Queensland Conference. He was succeeded in this position in 1914 by Edwin Butz.
His business sense and aptitude for remembering names and faces had gained him a reputation for administrative skill, and in 1915 he was elected president of the Australasian Union Conference.  During this time he preached in Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, and the United States of America.

From 1922 until 1926 he served as vice-president and associate treasurer of the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists.

He returned to North America in 1930 to attend the General Conference Session, where he was elected President of the General Conference, in no small part due to his financial ability.  He directed the Adventist church during a time of budget-cutting and consolidation, while accomplishing a period of denominational growth.

When his term ended in 1936, he returned to Queensland, Australia, where he assumed the duties of vice-president of the Australasian Division and president of the Australasian Union Conference.  He retired in 1944. He died on 24 December 1962 at Sydney Sanitarium and Hospital, and was buried in Northern Suburbs Cemetery in Sydney, Australia.

Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965,"Belgium was represented by Lize Marke, with the song ""Als het weer lente is"", at the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 20 March in Naples. Marke was chosen internally to be the Belgian representative, and the song was chosen in the national final on 13 February. Marke had previously finished second in the Belgian preselection in 1963.

There was a minor controversy after the selection when it came to light that ""Als het weer lente is"" had previously been performed on TV (by the following year's Belgian representative Tonia), but after some deliberation broadcaster BRT decided not to disqualify the song, as none of the rules of the European Broadcasting Union in effect at the time regarding song selection had been broken.

Before Eurovision

National final
The final was hosted by Nand Baert at the Amerikaans Theater in Brussels. Six songs were performed by Marke and the winner was chosen by a 20-member jury consisting of 10 ""experts"" and 10 members of the public. It is not known how the songs were scored, nor whether the votes of the experts and the public carried equal weight.

At Eurovision 
On the night of the final Marke performed 8th in the running order, following Norway and preceding Monaco. Voting was by each national jury awarding 5, 3 and 1 points to its three favourite songs. At the close of the voting ""Als het weer lente is"" was one of four songs (along with the entries from Finland, Germany and Spain) which had failed to register a single point. This was the third time that Belgium had found itself at the foot of the Eurovision scoreboard, and the second (and to date last) time the country had finished with the infamous nul-points.

The Belgian jury vote was unique under this system, as only two songs had received any votes at all from the 10 jury members. Under the rules then in effect, this meant that they awarded 6 points (rather than the apparent maximum 5) to the United Kingdom and 3 points to Italy.

Voting 
Belgium did not receive any points at the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest.

1933 Pittsburgh mayoral election,"The Mayoral election of 1933 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1933. In a realigning election, Democrats regained control of the mayor's office for the first time in 28 years; they have not relinquished this position since. The incumbent mayor, John Herron of the Republican Party chose to run for his first full term. Herron had been elevated to the executive office from his position as city council president after Charles H. Kline resigned over a fiscal scandal; he inherited a party whose once efficient machinery was in crisis. Democrats, led by new powerful grassroots organizer David Lawrence (a future mayor) selected William McNair, an idealistic and outspoken attorney as their candidate. With the beginnings of the New Deal being set into place, Pittsburgh's strong labor community moved rapidly toward the Democrats, creating a huge shift in voting patterns and allowing McNair to win.

Primary elections

Incumbent mayor John Herron won a divided Republican Primary against Councilman Joseph A. McArdle and Register of Wills Joseph Mackrell.

William McNair won the Democratic Primary.

General election
A total of 179,425 votes were cast.

Herron received 75,405 votes on the Republican ticket, 258 on the Citizens' Party ticket, and 11 on non-partisan ballots.
†Mackrell received 154 votes on Liberal Party and 101 on Square Deal Party ballots.

Harris Levey,"Harris Levey (August 13, 1921 – August 18, 1984), whose pseudonyms included Lee Harris, Leland Harris, and Harris Levy,  was a comic book artist for DC Comics primarily in the 1940s. He co-created the Golden Age superhero Air Wave, who has continued, in new permutations, into the 21st century.

Early life 
As a teenager, Harris Levey studied at DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx. During his time there, he contributed illustrations to its literary magazine, The Magpie.

DC Comics 

Harris changed his name legally from ""Harris Levey"" to ""Leland Harris"" in his late teens following high school. After graduating, he worked briefly as an assistant to a theatrical magician billed as ""Dante.

His first known credited comic book work was the one-page filler ""Super Sleuths"" in Fox Comics' Mystery Men Comics #5 (Dec. 1939), near the beginning of the period historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Creator credits were not routinely given during this period, making a comprehensive account of Levey's credits difficult to ascertain. However, following a story drawn for MLJ Comics in 1940, standard databases credit him as artist for a several-year on Detective Comics from the publisher National Comics, a forerunner of DC Comics. Among his first works there, he co-created the superhero Air Wave with a writer tentatively identified as either Mort Weisinger or Murray Boltinoff, the DC Comics superhero Air Wave. Levey, credited as Lee Harris, drew the character's seven- to eight-page adventures from Detective Comics #60 (Dec. 1942) to at least #74 (April 1943). At this point he left the comics industry to join the army.

He returned to comics with a Rin-Tin-Tin story in DC's Real Fact Comics #2 (June 1946) before taking over Air Wave's art once more in Detective Comics #114-137 (Aug. 1946 - July 1948).

Harris, often referred to in comic-book literature as ""Harris Levy"", generally signed his DC work as ""Lee Harris"", sometimes simply ""Harris"", or as ""Leland Harris"" (the latter being his legal name at the time).

Harris' son, Jonathan Levey, was interviewed by Richard Arndt about Harris' contributions of artwork for DC comics and other publications, carried out during the Golden Age of comics. This 28 page interview was featured prominently in issue # 125 (June 2014) of Alter Ego Magazine: http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=122&products_id=1123 and was edited by internationally recognized Comic Historian, Roy Thomas. This feature article includes dozens of high-resolution colour scans scanned images of Harris' original artwork and serves as verification and as a rich resource on the artistry and contributions of Harris.

Commercial art and advertising 

Circa 1948, Harris left the comic book field. In 1954, prior to his marriage to Elinor Seidl (1955), Harris changed his name legally from ""Leland Harris"", back to his original given name of ""Harris Levey"". In 1956 and 1963, Harris and his wife had two sons. By the early 1960s, while living in the Stuyvesant Town apartment complex in Manhattan, Harris took a job with the New York Journal American newspaper. There and subsequently at The New York Times he worked in commercial illustration, layout, design, and advertising copy.

During this period he created freelance cover illustrations for paperback book covers. He also illustrated the cover of the March 1953 issue of the science-fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories, credited as Harris Levey.

Harris left the New York Times to serve as art director for the New York City advertising agencies Fuller-Smith & Ross, LM Frolich, Foote Cone & Belding, Ted Bates, and NW Ayer. In the early 1980s, Harris worked on print ads and a string of television commercials for the Bomstein/Gura Agency in Washington, D.C.

Death 
During a weekend with his wife at a cabin near Crown Point, New York in the Adirondack Mountains, Harris suffered a heart attack during a hike. He was taken to Lake Placid Memorial Hospital, where he succumbed to heart failure at age 63.

Peter Moeschlin,"Peter Moeschlin (10 May 1924 - 2003) was a Swiss photographer known for reportage, press and publicity photography, for fine art imagery and as a motion picture director.

Life and professional work

Peter Moeschlin was born and was active in Basel, where he was apprenticed to Carl Hoffmann (1883–1969) and then took various employment as a photographer, including (from 1943 to 1947) in Studio Eidenbenz, founded in 1933 by the brothers Hermann, Reinhold and Willi Eidenbenz, who also employed Robert Frank.

Moeschlin spent eight months in England in 1947 as freelance reportage photographer and the following year spent several months in French North Africa. He was a reporter for Die Woche in the early 1950s, leaving to take up freelance professional work.

In 1951, in partnership with Christian Baur, he opened the Atelier Moeschlin + Baur in Basel, producing architectural, industrial, advertising and art photography, and publishing a picture book on Pablo Casals 1956.

He made a 20 minute documentary film Gefahr Nordwest. Seenoteinsatz in der Nordsee ('Danger North-West: sea rescues in the North Sea') during 1956-8, and in 1959/60 he was an assistant director and manager of film productions.

After 1967 he returned to working from his own photographic studio.

Fine art photography 
In his personal work he was a disciple of Otto Steinert’s ‘Fotoform’, of which Moeschlin's slow-shutter, semi-abstract Seagull in Flight was identified as an example by historian of photography Helmut Gernsheim and featured in LIFE magazine.

Recognition

Awarded the Eidgenössisches Stipendium (Federal Art Scholarship) in 1950, in 1955 Moeschlin was recognised with acceptance into the Kollegium Schweizer Photographen and in the same year his low-angle picture of two elderly women in animated conversation in the street was selected for MoMA’s world-touring The Family of Man exhibition curated by Edward Steichen.

Josef Albert Meisinger,"Josef Albert Meisinger (14 September 1899 – 7 March 1947), also known as the ""Butcher of Warsaw"", was an SS functionary in Nazi Germany. He held a position in the Gestapo and was a member of the Nazi Party. During the early phases of World War II Meisinger served as commander of Einsatzgruppe IV on Poland. From 1941 to 1945 he worked as liaison for the Gestapo at the German embassy in Tokyo. He was arrested in Japan in 1945, convicted of war crimes and was executed in Warsaw, Poland.

Early life 

Meisinger was born in Munich, the son of Josef and Berta Meisinger; he enlisted on 23 December 1916 and served during World War I in the 230th Minenwerfer Company (a type of short-range mortar), 22nd Bavarian Pioneer Battalion in the 30th Bavarian Reserve Division. After being wounded in battle he was awarded the Iron Cross and the Bavarian Military Merit Cross. On 18 January 1919 he attained the rank of Vizefeldwebel (senior sergeant), and on 19 April 1919 he entered the Freikorps under Franz Ritter von Epp, with whom he fought against the Soviet Republic of Bavaria. On 1 October 1922 he began working at the Munich Police Headquarters. As leader of the III Platoon of the II Company of the Freikorps Oberland, he took part in the Hitlerputsch on 8–9 November 1923.

He was inducted on 5 March 1933 into the SS and then into the Bavarian Political Police on 9 March 1933, thus coming into official contact with Heinrich Müller, Franz Josef Huber and Reinhard Heydrich (with whom he had served in the Freikorps). At that point in time, Heinrich Himmler was chief of the Munich Police and Heydrich was commander of Department IV, the political police. Meisinger became a member of the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933. He received the Blood Order Medal of the Nazi Party on 9 November 1933.

Nazi career 

On 20 April 1934, Meisinger was promoted to SS-Obertruppführer. Heydrich was appointed chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Immediately thereafter, Heydrich transferred to its Berlin office and took with him trusted colleagues: Heinrich Müller (Gestapo), Franz Josef Huber and Meisinger, referred to as the Bajuwaren-Brigade (Bavarian Brigade). On 9 May, Meisinger was promoted to SS-Untersturmführer (2nd lieutenant) in the Dezernat II 1 H and II H 1, which had the following tasks:
 Uncovering of opponents of Adolf Hitler within the Nazi Party
 Prosecution of homosexuals
 Prosecution of cases of abortion
 Prosecution of cases of intimate relations between Jews and non-Jews.

On 24 June 1934, he went to hear Erich Klausener at the Catholic Congress in Berlin and informed Heydrich that Klausener had made anarchist statements. On 30 June 1934, Klausener was shot by SS officer Kurt Gildisch in his office at the Prussian transportation ministry. After the war, Walter Schellenberg the former head of the foreign intelligence section of the SD in the RHSA, described Meisinger as:

One of the most evil creatures among Heydrich's bunch of thugs and he carried out the vilest of his orders...He was a frightening individual, a large, coarse-faced man with a bald head and an incredibly ugly face. However, like many men of his type, he had drive and energy and an unscrupulous sort of cleverness...As a result of his long police experience he knew a good deal about the workings and methods of the Comintern.

Role in the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair 

From 1936 to 1938 Meisinger was a leader in the Gestapo in charge of the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion (Reichszentrale zur Bekämpfung der Homosexualität und Abtreibung) in the Gestapo Central Headquarters in the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo). During this period he was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel). In early 1938 Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring and Himmler wanted to dispose of Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, a conservative member of the army's high command and Hitler's Minister of Defense. Meisinger's investigation revealed that Blomberg's wife, Erna Gruhn, had been a prostitute with a police record and once posed for pornographic photos. Blomberg was forced to resign.

In 1936 Meisinger had uncovered allegations of homosexuality made against the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Colonel General Werner von Fritsch. A file was prepared and Heydrich passed the information on to Hitler. Hitler chose to dismiss the allegations and ordered Heydrich to destroy the file. However, he did not do so.

In late January 1938, Göring wanted to dispose of von Fritsch as he did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior. Heydrich resurrected the old file on Fritsch. Meisinger saw it as an opportunity for advancement, since he knew that Himmler and the SS regarded homosexuals as a danger to the regime. However, Meisinger's police work was judged to be sloppy and Heydrich and Müller were dissatisfied. At one point, Meisinger and Huber interrogated Otto Schmidt, a notorious criminal whose Berlin gang specialized in the blackmail of homosexuals. Schmidt identified von Fritsch as a man whom he had witnessed engaging in homosexual acts in 1933. When Meisinger provided a photograph of Fritsch on which was clearly printed Fritsch's name, title and military rank, Schmidt jumped at the chance to advance himself by slandering the general. Heydrich resubmitted the updated von Fritsch file to Hitler. Werner Best, in describing this incident, called Meisinger ""a primitive man with clumsy methods"". It was eventually determined that von Fritsch had been confused with Rittmeister Achim von Frisch. The accusations against Fritsch broke down in court and members of the German officer corps were appalled at Fritsch's treatment. Meisinger's career in the Gestapo was almost terminated.

Activities in Poland 

As a consequence of Meisinger's and his agency's failure, he and others were replaced, transferred for disciplinary reasons or dismissed. In 1938 he was transferred to work in the archives of the principal SD office, but by September 1939 he was appointed Deputy Commander of the Einsatzgruppe IV in Poland. On 1 January 1940, after promotion to SS-Standartenführer (colonel), Meisinger was appointed Commander of the State Police in the Warsaw District, replacing Lothar Beutel who had been denounced for corruption.

Meisinger proceeded to apply brutal force against Poles, mostly those of Jewish descent. As part of the German AB-Aktion in Poland, he authorized the Palmiry massacre, the mass shooting of 1,700 people in the forest near Palmiry. As a reprisal for the murder of a Polish policeman, he ordered the execution of 55 Jewish residents on 22 November 1939, and on 20 December, the execution of 107 Poles as a reprisal for the murder of two Germans. Meisinger became so notorious that he was called the ""Butcher of Warsaw"" (although this sobriquet was also given to SS-Gruppenführer Heinz Reinefarth). According to Schellenberg, his atrocities in Warsaw even appalled his superiors: ""I had collected a huge file which proved him to be so utterly bestial and corrupt as to be practically inhuman...At this stage...Heydrich intervened: Meisinger knew too much, and Heydrich managed to prevent the trial from taking place."" Heydrich's appeal to Himmler saved Meisinger from court-martial and possible execution. He was sent to Tokyo as a means of keeping him at arm's length until the dust had settled.

During his trial in 1947 Meisinger stated that he was not in Warsaw after October 1940, but it is likely that he participated in the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto.

Activities in Shanghai and Japan 

From 1 April 1941 to May 1945 Meisinger acted as Gestapo liaison connecting leaders and particular agents of the SD at the German Embassy in Tokyo. His duties included seeking out enemies of the Third Reich within the German community, using various informants. He was also the SD liaison officer to the Japanese Secret Intelligence Service. One of his tasks in Japan was the observation of the secret Soviet agent Richard Sorge (who was under suspicion in Berlin) but Meisinger soon became Sorge's constant drinking companion and, unwittingly, one of Sorge's best sources of information.

In 1941 Meisinger tried to influence the Japanese to exterminate approximately 18,000–20,000 Jews who had escaped from Austria and Germany and who were living in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. His proposals included the creation of a concentration camp on Chongming Island in the delta of the Yangtze, or starvation on freighters off the coast of China. The Japanese admiral responsible for overseeing Shanghai would not yield to pressure from Meisinger; however, the Japanese built a ghetto in the neighborhood of Hongkew which had already been planned by Tokyo in 1939: a slum with about twice the population density of Manhattan. The ghetto was strictly isolated by Japanese soldiers under the command of the Japanese official Kano Ghoya, and Jews could only leave it with special permission. Some 2,000 of them died in the Shanghai Ghetto during the wartime period.

Arrest, trial and conviction 

On 6 September 1945 Meisinger surrendered to two war correspondents, Clark Lee of the INS and Robert Brumby of MBS, at the Fujiya Hotel in Hakone, Kanagawa. The reporters drove him to the Yokohama headquarters of the Counter-Intelligence Corps where Meisinger turned himself in. He was held in the Yokohama Jail where he underwent intensive questioning for two weeks before being transferred to U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters in Frankfurt. In November 1945, under the escort of Lt. Col. Jennis R. Galloway, and Major James W. McColl, both of the 441st CIC detachment, he was flown to Washington, D.C. for questioning on his involvement in the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto.

In 1946 he was extradited to Poland. In Warsaw on 17 December 1946 he was charged, together with Ludwig Fischer (Nazi Governor of the Warsaw District), Max Daume (Acting Commander of the Ordnungspolizei in Warsaw), and Ludwig Leist (Nazi Plenipotentiary Governor of the City of Warsaw) of Nazi crimes. The trials took place between 17 December 1946 and 24 February 1947. On 3 March 1947 the Supreme National Tribunal in Warsaw sentenced Meisinger to death, and on 7 March he was executed in Warsaw's Mokotów Prison.

God of Our Fathers,"""God of Our Fathers"" is a 19th-century American Christian hymn, written in 1876 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States Declaration of Independence.

The hymn was written by Daniel C. Roberts, a priest in the Protestant Episcopal Church serving, at the time, as rector of St. Thomas & Grace Episcopal churches in Brandon, Vermont. Roberts had served in the American Civil War in the 84th Ohio Infantry.

In 1892, Roberts sent the hymn anonymously to the General Convention of the Episcopal Church to be considered by a group tasked with revising the Episcopal hymnal. If the group accepted his hymn, Roberts said he would send them his name. The commission approved it. The hymnal editor and organist George W. Warren were to choose a hymn for the celebration of the Centennial of the United States Constitution. They chose Roberts' lyrics, which were originally sung to a tune called ""Russian Hymn."" Warren wrote a new tune called ""National Hymn.""

Simsbury station,"Simsbury station is a former railroad station in the center of Simsbury, Connecticut.  Built in 1875, it is a distinctive example of a railroad station with Italianate styling.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 26, 1976 as Simsbury Railroad Depot. Presently, it houses a restaurant, called ""Plan B"".

Description and history

The former Simsbury Railroad Depot stands on the east side of Simsbury's downtown area, on the east side of Railroad Street between Station Street and Phelps Lane.  It is a narrow rectangular single-story brick building, oriented north-south, with the road to the west and the former railroad right-of-way to the east.  The street-facing facade is divided into six bays, each slightly recessed with a band of brick corbelling at the top, and brick pilasters between.  As built, there were three window bays, two pedestrian entrances, and a freight door in these bays; they have since been altered for use by the restaurant.

Simsbury was first served by the Farmington Canal in 1826.  The canal failed in 1846, and its route was overbuilt by a railroad line in 1850.  This line provided service between New Haven and points further north on the Connecticut River.  A second line was run through the town in 1871, connecting Hartford with Albany, New York.  A station is documented as standing on this site in 1873, but the records of the Connecticut Western Railway indicate the present building was constructed in 1875.  The styling is particularly unusual for the period, as most stations built at the time were wood frame structures that had more Gothic Revival elements.

Prime integer topology,"In mathematics, specifically general topology, the prime integer topology and the relatively prime integer topology are topologies on the set of positive integers, i.e. the set }.

Construction 
Given two positive integers a and b, define the following congruence class:

Then the relatively prime integer topology is the topology generated from the basis

where  is the greatest common divisor function, and the prime integer topology is the topology generated from the subbasis

The set of positive integers with the relatively prime integer topology or with the prime integer topology are examples of topological spaces that are Hausdorff but not regular.

Henry Hudson (artist),"Henry Hudson (born 1982, Bath) is a British artist who lives and works in London.  He is best known for his use of Plasticine as his artistic medium in the creation of textured ‘paintings’. Hudson's most notable exhibition to date was The Rise and Fall of Young Sen – The Contemporary Artist’s Progress, which was shown at Sotheby's SI2 Gallery, London in May 2015. The exhibition consisted of ten large scale Plasticine paintings, depicting a contemporary version of William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress. According to the New York Times, all ten paintings were sold prior to the show opening.

Biography
Hudson grew up in Yorkshire and attended Ampleforth College. He graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 2005 after taking a foundation degree at Chelsea College of Art and Design. His father is sculptor, Richard Hudson.

Artwork
Hudson makes paintings, sculpture, etchings and performance based work. For the past seven years, his medium of choice has been Plasticine. In The Telegraph newspaper Hudson explains “I did performance as a student, but when I left I was broke and looking to make things I could sell. I’ve always loved the impasto painters: Leon Kossoff, Frank Auerbach, anyone a bit gloopy. So Plasticine felt like something I could run with.”

In the New York Times Hudson was quoted as saying that “there are certain things you can do with Plasticine that you can’t do with paint”, the writer Laura K. Jones has said that Hudson's use of Plasticine creates paintings that look “more like oil paintings than oil paintings themselves” and the critic Richard Dormant has described Hudson as an “astonishing young painter”.

Hudson's work is concerned with ideas of Britishness and contemporary culture. His most recent series, The Rise and Fall of Young Sen – The Contemporary Artist’s Progress, satirises social stereotypes and the vulgarity that can stem from wealth, frame and consumer culture. Dylan Jones wrote in GQ magazine: “the pictures are saturated with contemporary cultural references ‘satirising the absurdity of modern life, from political issues to social stereotypes and the contemporary art world’”.  Hudson also often pays tribute other artists from history either through emulating their style or re-appropriating their compositions. Examples include Van Gogh, Hieronymus Bosch as well as William Hogarth.

A Rake Revisited
Hudson’s series, A Rake Revisited, which was shown at the Sir John Soane's Museum in London 2011, also appropriated Hogarth’s A Rake's Progress but with Hudson himself characterised as the main character, Tom Rakewell. The director of the museum at the time, Tim Knox, explained to Cassone magazine “There is a pervasive sense of fear that is even more tangible in Hudson’s Plasticine clad canvases than in the original paintings. His work both subverts and celebrates Hogarth’s originals, adding his own story to a work which has become enmeshed in our culture, part of our national consciousness.  He embellishes and exaggerates and makes these images from nearly three centuries ago alive for us again, inviting us to look just as acutely at the state of our nation today.”

The artist Marc Quinn has said, “Hudson aligns himself with an irreverent and eccentric British tradition in art that is really the saviour of it… it’s a lineage of non-conformity yet quintessentially Britishness that is unique… Hudson has reinvented this tradition in his visual, trembling, vibrating, sculpted paintings.”

The Director of Sotheby's SI2 gallery Fru Tholstrup described Hudson to Wall Street International as “one of the most innovative young artists working today”. She went on to say that “through his painterly application of Plasticine, Hudson has developed a truly unique artistic language”. Damien Hirst has described Hudson as “F***ing mad”.

Collectors
Notable collectors of Hudson's work include Marc Quinn, Robert Hiscox, Jay Jopling, Mario Testino, Tim Jeffries, Tommy Hilfiger and Mark Hix. Hudson has also been photographed by photographers Gautier De Blonde for The Telegraph and David Bailey for GQ.

Hudson has had numerous solo and group shows in London, Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, New York, Miami and Milan at venues including TJ Boulting (formerly Trolley Gallery), Sir John Soane's Museum, 20 Hoxton Square, F2 Gallery, Christie's, 33 Portland Place, Fine Art Society and as part of the Hiscox Collection.

Recent
In 2016 Hudson's exhibited at Carl Kostyál Gallery, London and Sotheby's SI2 gallery in New York. He was recently nominated from Pulse Miami Beach art prize for a series of Woodburytype prints.

Thames & Hudson published an 8-page profile on Hudson in the publication London Burning by Maryam Eisler, where Henry paid tribute to the vices of Hogarth's Tom Rakewell. The last photograph in the series depicted Hudson lying naked on William Hogarth's grave in Chiswick, London.

In April 2015, Sotheby's published a feature on Henry Hudson in coordination with his show at Sotheby's S|2 Gallery titled, Henry Hudson: The Contemporary Artist's Progress - The Rise and Fall of Young Sen. In an essay about Hudson Nimrod Kamer described him as a 'champagne fascist'. In 2015 he was extensively interviewed by GQ Magazine, with Dylan Jones describing Hudson as an 'iconic' artist"".

In March 2016 he was profiled by Flora Alexandra Ogilvy for The Gentleman's Journal magazine. On June 2020, following the Covid-19 pandemic, Hudson painted a mural in Roman Road, East London, touching on the coronaVirus as well as Black Lives Matter and the controversial 5G antennas surrounding the area. 

Hudson currently lives and works in London.

Rostral neuropore,"The rostral neuropore or anterior neuropore is a region corresponding to the opening of the embryonic neural tube in the anterior portion of the developing prosencephalon. The central nervous system develops from the neural tube, which initially starts as a plate of cells in the ectoderm and this is called the neural plate, the neural plate then undergoes folding and starts closing from the center of the developing fetus, this leads to two open ends, one situated cranially/rostrally and the other caudally. Bending of the neural plate begins on day 22, and the cranial neuropore closes on day 24. giving rise to the lamina terminalis of the brain.

Failure to close
 Failure of closure of the anterior neuropore during embryogenesis will lead to anencephaly, the failure of the brain and skull to develop. In less severe situations it may lead to different forms of encephalocele (i.e. cranium bifidum). There are three forms of cranium bifidum: mengocele, meningo-encephalocele and meningohydro-encephalocele. In which respectively protrude the meninges, the meninges and brain tissue and lastly meninges, brain tissue and cranial ventricles.
 Failure of closure of the posterior neuropore (caudal neuropore) during embryogenesis will lead to spina bifida. this condition is always marked by a local lack of osteogenesis, or bone growth. The reason is that the correct differentiation and placement of underlying tissues (the spinal chord and spinal nerves and associated tissues) induce the osteogenesis, even small flaws in the underlying tissues can lead to a problem in the formation of the spine (vertebrae). Occasionally spina bifida is accompanied by a protrusion of the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (meningocele) or protrusion of meninges, cerebrospinal fluid and nerve tissue (meningomyelocele).

Always Let Me Go,"Always Let Me Go is a live album by American pianist Keith Jarrett's ""Standards Trio"" featuring Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette recorded in concert in April 2001 at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall and Tokyo Bunka Kaikan, in Japan and released on the ECM label in 2002.

It is the fourth album to feature mainly original improvised material by the trio following Changes (1983), Changeless (1987), and Inside Out (2000).

Reception

The AllMusic review by Glenn Swan awarded the album 4½ stars and states, ""After 20 years of working together, they trust each other (and the audience) enough to deliver over two hours of unscripted music... it adds a rewarding layer of understanding and appreciation, as few musicians can deliver such diamonds with so little structure in place. Song for song, the symbiosis is a marvel to behold — and the audience knows it. These are gods at play, and the lightning bolts they toss around are awe-inspiring"".

In a review for DownBeat, Thomas Conrad wrote: ""Always Let Me Go sustains a heightened sense of imaginative focus through its sudden shifts, peaks and valleys, the exquisitely realized songs within songs that the trio comes upon... and the dramatic swings of its dynamic scope. In its 20th year, this trio keeps growing in its ability to challenge the creativity of its listeners.""

The authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz commented: ""As a document of Jarrett's almost 150th performance in Japan, it's impeccable.""

Panzer Division Tatra,"Panzer Division Tatra (Panzer Training Division Tatra) was an armored division of the German Heer formed in Moravia in August 1944. The division was hastily formed during the Slovak National Uprising of 1944 when the Germans feared that Slovakia might break away from the Axis powers and open the way for the advancing Red Army. After a brief punitive expedition against the Slovaks, the division was converted into a training formation. In March 1945, it was reorganized into the 232nd Panzer Division and was lost fighting in western Hungary.

History

Panzer Division Tatra
The division was formed as an emergency battle group (German: Alarmkampfgruppe) around a core of 1st Panzer Division veterans, the units from the 178th Panzer Division, and the staff of the Kleine Karpaten training facility in Malacky. Other personnel, according to Samuel Mitcham, ""came from all over the map"". The division's only tank battalion had 28 obsolete Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks and three Tiger Is. The division began by suppressing resistance in southern Moravia, and on 29 August 1944, moved to Žilina in north-western Slovakia.

The improvised division performed well against the Slovak uprising. It crushed the Slovaks, who were being aided by Soviet advisers, and recaptured Bratislava (German: Pressburg). After this initial success, the division was reorganized into a training division (German: Panzer-Feldausbildungs-Division Tatra). The division incorporated the XVII Panzer Corps command and its mechanized infantry and units of inland military districts; the men of the 1st Panzer eventually left Tatra. The division remained in Slovakia until the end of 1944. In March 1945 (or, according to different sources, on 21 February 1945), the division was reorganized into the 232nd Reserve Panzer Division.

232nd Panzer Division
After the reorganization, former training regiments of Tatra (82nd and 85th Training Regiments) were also reorganized and renamed the 101st and 102nd Panzer Grenadiers. Auxiliary units (flak, etc.) retained their original Tatra numbers. The unit was hurriedly sent to join the reserves of Army Group South and was almost immediately thrown into defensive action with the 8th Army.

On 26 March, the division was stationed near Marcaltő in Hungary. The fighting continued for three more days. Divisional commander Generalmajor Hans-Ulrich Back was wounded on 29 March and escaped captivity. The division ceased to exist by 1 April 1945.

Nishan (actor),"Nishan K. P. Nanaiah, known mononymously as Nishan, is an Indian actor who has predominantly worked in Malayalam cinema along with Hindi, Bengali, Kannada,Tamil and Telugu films. Born in Coorg, Karnataka and brought up in Calcutta, Nishan is a graduate of Film and Television Institute of India, Pune.

Personal life

Born Kallichanda Prasad Nishan Nanaiah, Nishan was born to Kallichanda Somaiah Prasad (K. S. Prasad) a customs & central excise officer, and late
K. Padma Prasad, in Coorg, Karnataka. He was brought up in Kolkata, West Bengal. He was a professional tennis player, who represented Calcutta University and played many All India and National tournaments. He did his graduation in Mass communication from St. Xaviers college Kolkata and post graduation (in acting) from the Pune Film Institute (FTII). Nishan speaks six languages, and is very good at picking up languages and dialects.

Career
Nishan debuted in the Hindi film Cycle Kick (Produced by Subhash Ghai), the film did not release in theatres.. It went to film festivals and then got a staggered release.. The rights was then acquired by zee.. film was then shown on zee cinemas and now presently it's there in Zee5.. 
He got a career break in legendary director Shyamaprasad's  Malayalam film Ritu in 2009, (for which he also received great critical acclaim as well as won his Best Debut award), along with a Telugu release Manorama in the same year, opposite lead actress Charmee. He became a notable actor through Sibi Malayil's Apoorvaragam, which was released in 2010, and was one of the biggest commercial hits of that year. It also completed a run of 100 days (which is very rare and a great feat to achieve for a film with newcomers in today's times). Till date Nishan has worked as a LEADING MAN in around 15 Malayalam films, 1 Telugu film, 3 Hindi films, 1 kannada film, 2 Tamil films, 2 Bengali films and 1 Bengali web series. He is currently shooting for a Hindi feature film Nastik (upcoming film), with Arjun Rampal.

Alma Mater

After graduating, he moved to Mumbai to try his luck in Bollywood. He worked with Subhash Ghai in a film titled Cycle Kick, which was released in 2011. As an actor, he believes in expanding his horizons and hence he decided to venture down south. His first southern break was the Telugu film Manorama (2009). The film, along with Nishan's performance was critically very well acclaimed. His character in the film was noted, however simultaneously. He got a call from legendary Malayalam director Shyamaprasad during those days, for playing the lead role in his film, Ritu (2009). About the selection, the actor said, ""Shyamaprasad sir had seen my stills from a model coordinator in Chennai. But I was not sure if I could do the film because Malayalam is a tough language. Shyam sir, however, told me that he was confident that I could do the role."" Rithu was a critical hit, which won him the best debut award.

After Ritu, he got another notable role in Sibi Malayil's Apoorvaragam. Apoorvaragam was a sleeper hit. It ran for 100+ days. This movie made Nishan a household name as it was a commercial hit. In February, Ee Adutha Kaalathu released in which he played the role of Rustam. This film received positive response from critics and audiences, and is considered a path-breaker for its bold and realistic narration and the innovative style of weaving story threads together. Nishan's role of Rustam was more appreciated as it had a grey shade. He also starred in Bejoy Nambiar's David alongside Vikram. His role of Peter was appreciated by the critics.
His last release was Geethaanjali (Malayalam) directed by Priyadarshan, starring Mohanlal. The film went on to be a semi hit.

Nishan's forthcoming release is Badlapur Boys (Hindi) directed by newcomer Shailesh Verma. It is based on the Indian traditional rural sport, kabaddi.
